/** The agent portfolio manager, in-process: the adapters, the openness dial,
 * the approval queue, the FLIGHT BOARD and a hash-chained ledger behind one
 * object. The HTTP server, the MCP server and the scripted demo all drive
 * this; it binds no port itself, so the unit tests and the headless demo run
 * anywhere.
 *
 * The airport: every agent request is a FLIGHT with a number whose prefix is
 * the agent's code (PM-0001 the page's scripted agent, CC-0002 Claude Code
 * over MCP, TD-0003 the terminal demo). A flight has LEGS — one per account
 * the money touches — and a leg can be an ok, a refusal in plain words, or a
 * card waiting for the human. Every ledger row carries the flight and the
 * agent, so the flight log reads end to end.
 *
 *   openFlight / fly / note     the page agent's multi-leg flights
 *   execute(account, intent, agent)  one-leg flight (the MCP server's write)
 *   quote / order               the tower's routing service: one order priced
 *                               at every venue (CEX books, DEX pools) and split
 *                               across them; `order` flies the slices as one
 *                               flight
 *   flyBatch                    the slices of one order: ONE decision — the
 *                               wallet judges the whole order (splitting never
 *                               slips under an allowance) and raises one card,
 *                               not one per slice
 *   decide(approvalId, …)       the human's answer to a card, as one more leg
 *   read / overview             never gated; one read across every account
