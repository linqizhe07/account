/** The PAPER ACCOUNTS' CURVE: what the paper accounts were worth over the last day, week or month, or since they started — the page's
 * Paper book and an agent's `portfolio_history` with `paper`.
 *
 * Paper money is never on the net worth curve (account/networth.ts): it is not money. It has a curve of its own, told account by account
 * and then added up:
 *
 *   a paper account the account keeps itself (live:paper)   its BOOK is the account's own record, so its past is known, not guessed: every
 *                       fill is in it, and the prices between fills are the public sources' bars (live/paper-history.ts tells it again,
 *                       from the day it started with its paper money). Where the service also wrote a point for it (the paper log beside
 *                       the net worth log, every five minutes while it runs), the point it wrote wins: it is what the book said then,
 *                       funding and all. The told-again past fills what the service did not see — before the paper log existed, or while
 *                       the service was not running
 *   a venue's own paper account (Alpaca's paper, Hyperliquid's testnet)   no book here: its curve is the points the service wrote, from its
 *                       first one on, as the real curve is
 *
 * The CHANGE is each account's own, from where it stood at the range's start — or, an account started inside the range, from the paper
 * money it started with — to now, added up. Starting a paper account is not a gain: its curve starts at its starting money, and its change
 * is what it made or lost since. The last point of every account is its value now (the same read as the figure), so the curve ends where
 * the figure stands.
