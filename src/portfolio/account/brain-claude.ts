/** THE HOUSE BRAIN: a Claude model through the Anthropic API, asked one structured question at a time by the desk (desk.ts). It reaches the
 * API the way the owner lets it: a key file in the home — <home>/credentials/brains/claude.json, {"apiKey": "<the key>"}, readable by the
 * user alone, read again at every check, so a key put there needs no restart (the page's key field writes it, the fix's command makes it)
 * — or, while that file is not there, the older <home>/credentials/anthropic/api-key.json, still read so a key the owner put there before
 * keeps working untouched; or, for an account started by hand, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (or ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN) in the service's environment,
 * which wins over both files. Nothing else: no profile of a command-line login is looked for — a key the account cannot see in one of
 * those places is not promised. Without any of them — or with a file that still holds the empty template or an example instead of a key —
 * it is not ready, and says what would make it so (BrainFix, brain-key.ts: the file's path, a command that runs as written, whether a
 * restart is needed, one plain sentence); it never pretends to think.
 *
 * The key goes to Anthropic's own API and nowhere else: the client is made with Anthropic's base URL named, so an ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL left
 * in the shell that started the account never carries the account's key elsewhere. And the other way round: a shell set up to send
 * Claude-format requests through a gateway (Claude Code's documented setups for OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Kimi and others export
 * ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=<the gateway> beside ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = <THAT GATEWAY'S key>) holds a credential that belongs
 * to the gateway, not to Anthropic. With ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL set to any origin but https://api.anthropic.com, the brain uses neither variable
 * — it is not ready, its fix names the host the variable points at and says to remove both and restart (an environment is changed only
 * where the service is started), and no client is ever made with that credential, so no cycle and no "Test the key" sends it to Anthropic.
 * What the brain says of itself for the Brains place (about) then names that variable as one that BLOCKS a saved key (envBlocks), never as
 * one that wins over it (envWins): a key saved on the page is not read either until the variables are gone.
 * The LaunchAgent starts the account with no such variables; this guards an account started by hand from such a shell. And the client
 * waits at most two minutes for an answer and asks again at most once (CLAUDE_TIMEOUT_MS, CLAUDE_MAX_RETRIES) — the SDK's own defaults are
 * ten minutes and two retries, while the desk's clock takes one step at a time and a cycle held for half an hour would hold every exit
 * behind it; "Test the key" waits at most fifteen seconds and never asks again (CLAUDE_TEST_TIMEOUT_MS), as the OpenAI-format test does,
 * so the route that asks it is never held for minutes on a network that does not answer.
 *
 * Each question is one request: a system prompt (the role and its charter), the data as text, and the answer constrained to the role's
 * JSON shape (structured outputs). Thinking is the model's own (adaptive, the default on these models); the depth is the desk's effort
 * setting. A decline (stop reason `refusal`), an answer cut by the token limit, or one that does not fit the shape is "no decision", said
 * so; a key the API rejects, a rate limit or an unreachable API is an error the desk writes in its room — the rejected key as its own kind
 * (E_BRAIN_KEY_REJECTED, carrying the fix), which the desk keeps as the brain's standing until a call is answered again. The API's own
 * token counts come back with every answer, so the desk's cost line is counted, not guessed.
 *
 * "Test the key" (test) asks the API for its list of models — a call that bills no token — and says whether the key was taken, in the
 * API's own words scrubbed of anything key-shaped.
 *
 * "Connect a key" (probe, asked by brain-detect.ts) asks the same list with a key the owner PASTED and has not saved: a client made for that
 * key alone, at Anthropic's own address, fifteen seconds and no second try, and never kept — the brain's own client stays the saved key's.
