/** AN OPENAI-FORMAT BRAIN: any endpoint that speaks OpenAI's chat-completions format — OpenAI itself, DeepSeek, xAI's Grok models, Meta's
 * Muse models, Moonshot's Kimi, Qwen, OpenRouter, Gemini's compatibility layer, Groq, Together, an Ollama or a vLLM on this machine, an
 * endpoint the owner names — asked the one structured question at a time the desk asks (desk.ts), the same as the Claude brain
 * (brain-claude.ts). ONE BRAIN PER PRESET (brains.ts makes them all at once, so several can hold a key at the same time and the desk's
 * hired one is the one asked): a preset says who the provider is (its id and label), where it is reached by default (its base URL, or
 * none where the owner must name one — Qwen's per-workspace URL, a custom endpoint), the models to suggest (from the provider's own page,
 * dated: suggestions, never the whole list), the efforts it takes, and its quirks.
 *
 * The owner says where and with what: the preset's key file <home>/credentials/brains/<id>.json — {"apiKey", "baseUrl", "model"},
 * readable by the user alone, read again at every check, so a key put there needs no restart — written by hand from the fix's command or
 * by the page's key field; for the "openai" preset, the older credentials/openai/api-key.json is still read while the new file is not
 * there, so a key the owner put there before keeps working untouched; and, for an account started by hand, OPENAI_API_KEY (with
 * OPENAI_BASE_URL and OPENAI_MODEL) in the service's environment, which wins over both files for the "openai" preset alone. The model on the
 * hire form wins over the file's, and one of the two must name a model as the endpoint names it — an empty one, or the old how-to's
 * "<the model, as the endpoint names it>", is the example and is refused as such; the price is the owner's number on the form (the
 * suggestions may carry the price the provider's page gave on the day it was read, said with that day). A LOCAL SERVER (Ollama, vLLM:
 * keyOptional) ignores the key and needs no file at all: with none, it is reached at its default address (http://localhost:11434/v1,
 * http://localhost:8000/v1) with no key, and is ready as soon as a model is named — on the form that chooses it as the desk's brain, or in
 * the file. The file is there only for another address, a model of its own, or a key the server was started with.
 *
 * A base URL is https, or http only to this machine's own loopback (localhost, 127.x, ::1): the key goes as a bearer, and over plain http
 * to any other host it would cross the network in the clear. A base URL whose path, or a model's name, looks like an API key (keyShaped,
 * brain-key.ts: a key pasted into the wrong field) is refused in words that never repeat it — never sent as a request's model to some
 * provider, never shown on the page or written in the room. And an endpoint that answers with a redirect is not followed (fetch's
 * redirect "error"): the question, the portfolio in it and the key go to the base URL the owner named and nowhere else — a 307 would carry
 * the body on to any address, plain http to another host included — so the brain says, in plain words, that the endpoint redirected and
 * that the address it points to is the one to name. Not ready, the brain says what would make it so the way the Claude brain does
 * (BrainFix, brain-key.ts), and a key the endpoint refuses (401, 403) is thrown as E_BRAIN_KEY_REJECTED with its fix, which the desk keeps
 * as the brain's standing until a call is answered again.
 *
 * Endpoints differ in what they take: OpenAI's own wants max_completion_tokens and takes reasoning_effort and a JSON schema; many others
 * know only max_tokens, or json_object. The brain starts from what the preset and the base URL's host say (DeepSeek takes json_object
 * only, and its JSON mode wants the word "json" in the prompt; Meta's Muse Spark always reasons and answers 400 to an effort of "none",
 * which is never sent there; a Qwen workspace in Singapore — a host under ap-southeast-1.maas.aliyuncs.com — where Alibaba's page says
 * structured output is "not supported yet" for that region's models (2026-10-15), is asked in json_object mode from the first question)
 * and, when the endpoint answers 400, changes the field the answer names (unnamed: the next untried one) and asks again — three tries at
 * most, nothing billed for a refused request, and the dialect that worked is kept for the next question. An
 * effort the provider does not take is not sent: its own default applies. The answer is checked against the role's shape (zod). In
 * json_object mode nothing holds the answer to the shape, so an answer that comes back empty (DeepSeek's JSON mode "may occasionally
 * return empty content"), not JSON or not the shape is asked once more — once, its tokens counted with the first's. A cut-off answer, a
 * content filter, a refusal or JSON that still does not fit is "no decision", said so. A key the endpoint rejects, an out balance, a rate
 * limit, a model it does not serve or an endpoint that cannot be reached is an error the desk writes in its room — the endpoint's own
 * words, never the key.
 *
 * "Test the key" (test): GET <base>/models, the one call every one of these endpoints answers without billing a token — the key taken or
 * refused in the endpoint's own words (scrubbed), the models it lists (for the owner's model field), and whether the model the owner means
 * is among them. Nothing is sent anywhere but the base URL the brain would call.
 *
 * "Connect a key" (probe, asked by brain-detect.ts): the same GET <base>/models, with a key the owner PASTED and has not saved, at the
 * preset's own address — never the key file's or the environment's, which may point anywhere: a pasted key goes only to the provider it
 * was recognised as. A model API's alone (a local server, a custom endpoint and Qwen's per-workspace address have none of their own). Where
 * the list is public (OpenRouter's), or a key may be taken and still call no model (xAI's, until its access list allows one), the preset's
 * keyCheck is asked first. A refusal is a 401 or a 403 — or a 400 that says it is about the key, as xAI's and Gemini's layer answer one. A
 * redirect is not followed here either; a list is read in either shape (Together's is a bare array); a model id is kept only when it
 * looks like one and holds no piece of the key.
