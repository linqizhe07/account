/** WHERE A BRAIN'S KEY GOES, said so a person can do it: the fix the desk's standing carries when a brain is not ready (BrainFix, desk.ts),
 * shared by the Claude brain (brain-claude.ts) and every OpenAI-format one (brain-openai.ts, one per preset in brains.ts).
 *
 * A brain reads its key from one file in the home, readable by the user alone, read again at every check — so a key put there needs no
 * restart. Each provider has its own: <home>/credentials/brains/<id>.json (brainKeyRef) — {"apiKey", "baseUrl"?, "model"?} — so OpenAI,
 * DeepSeek, Grok and the rest can all hold a key at once, and a venue that happens to be called "openai" never shares a file with a brain.
 * Two older files are still read, untouched, where the new one is not there yet: credentials/anthropic/api-key.json for Claude and
 * credentials/openai/api-key.json for OpenAI — so a key the owner put there before keeps working with nothing done. The new file, once it
 * is there, is the one read (and the one a problem is said about), even if the old one still holds a key: the owner's latest word wins.
 *
 * The fix names that file by its absolute path, says in one plain sentence what to do with it, and, where a command does it, gives
 * the command whole: run as it is written, it does the thing, with no value in it the owner must first replace. So a missing file is made
 * with an EMPTY template (the key's place is a pair of quotes with nothing between them, never a sample key that a pasted command would
 * leave behind looking like one) and opened in an editor, and the readiness checks refuse that empty template, and the old examples, as
 * "the example" — never as a key. A file other users can read is fixed with chmod; a file that is there but wrong is opened again. A key in
 * the service's environment is the one case no command fixes from here: the variable is set where the service is started, and a restart
 * is needed, which the fix says.
 *
 * What the page may be shown of a key is its masked tail (keyTail: "…" and the last four characters, and only for a key long enough that
 * four characters say little about it) — never the key, never more of it. A base URL in plain http is taken only for this machine's own
 * loopback (isLoopback): a key sent as a bearer over http to any other host would cross the network in the clear. Where words name a base
 * URL's host and that host looks like a key, they say "another address" instead (hostSaid).
 *
 * What a key LOOKS like (keyShaped) is decided here once, for every place that must refuse one where it does not belong — a model's name,
 * a base URL's path, a provider's id: the desk (desk.ts parseBrain), the brains (brain-openai.ts, brain-claude.ts), the key route and the
 * door (brain-keys.ts, server.ts), and the page (ui/brains.js brKeyShaped, a mirror of it). A base URL is judged by its own rule
 * (baseUrlKeyShaped, mirrored by the page's brBaseKeyShaped): its host as it was typed, label by label, and its path — where a segment that
 * is nothing but 32 to 39 hex characters is an account's id (Cloudflare's), not a key. The desk's own words (its name, the objective, the
 * charters), which may hold a 0x address, are asked only whether they hold a key that says what it is (prefixedKey). And a provider's own
 * words are shown only scrubbed of anything key-shaped (scrubbed), the key in use first, and every piece of it eight characters or longer.
 *
 * Paths are single-quoted for the shell (a quote inside one closed, escaped and opened again), so a home with spaces or quotes in its name
 * still runs as written. On a Mac the editor is TextEdit (`open -e`); elsewhere the owner's $EDITOR, else nano.
