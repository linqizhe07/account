/** THE ACCOUNT'S PUSH CHANNEL: what changes on the account, told to the pages listening as it happens (GET /api/account/stream, server.ts;
 * the page's end is ui/stream.js). One bus for the service: the paper accounts' books (live/paper.ts: an order's state, a fill, a position, the
 * cash, the book itself — a background look's fills as the owner's own; service.ts paperSaid), the account's own record (every statement line
 * the ledger takes, an order with it; a card raised) and the desk's floor (account/desk.ts, told on each change of its record or its work)
 * are emitted here, and each page holds one stream.
 *
 *   the wire      text/event-stream: `retry: 1000` first (a stream that drops is asked again after a second), then one frame an event —
 *                 `id: <run>.<seq>` (the run is this process's own mark, the seq rises by one an event, so a page names where it stopped),
 *                 `event: <type>`, `data: <JSON>`. A heartbeat every 15 s: a comment line, and an `hb` event without an id, so a page
 *                 that hears nothing for longer knows the stream is silent (a comment alone never reaches a page's script)
 *   two kinds     ACCOUNT events — order, fill, position, balance, paper, statement, card, desk, alert (a price alert fired) — go out at
 *                 once, in order, to every page,
 *                 and the last RING_SIZE of them are kept for a resume (the desk among them: a page that comes back after a gap hears that
 *                 its floor moved, and reads it again). COALESCED events — the market's quote, trades and book — go out at most once a
 *                 window per market (quote and trades 100 ms, book 250 ms): the first at once, the latest of what came within the window at
 *                 its end — and only to the pages that FOLLOW that market. They are never kept for a resume: a page reads the market afresh
 *   following     a page names itself when it opens its stream (?client=, a name of its own a tab keeps) and then says which markets it
 *                 shows (follow: POST /api/account/stream/markets, server.ts), at most MAX_FOLLOWS, each as `<venue>:<symbol>`; what it
 *                 follows is told to the service (onFollow), which streams those markets from the venues (live/stream-hub.ts) while a page
 *                 shows them, and emits their quote, book and trades under that key — or, for a key with a "~" before it (a market whose
 *                 price alone the page shows: a position's mark), its quote only. A page that goes away follows nothing any more (told
 *                 too). A page that named no client is sent the account events only. Each telling is numbered by the page (`n`, rising
 *                 with each it sends): one no later than the latest taken from it is let be, so two said back to back that overtake each
 *                 other on their way leave it following the later. The same tab come back under its name before its old stream was let
 *                 go carries what it followed over, and what each of those markets stands at now is told to it again at once (onAgain):
 *                 the page let go of what its old stream had pushed when that dropped
 *   a resume      a page that comes back names the last event it heard (Last-Event-ID, which a browser sends by itself when it reconnects,
 *                 or ?since= when it opens a new stream): the account events after it are sent again, from the ring. One from another
 *                 run, one the ring no longer reaches (more came meanwhile than it keeps), or none at all is sent a SNAPSHOT instead —
 *                 what the service says the account is now (its orders, its paper books), under the seq it stands at — and the page reads
 *                 afresh
 *   a slow page   one whose socket does not take a frame at once (res.write said false) is sent nothing more until it drains: meanwhile
 *                 its account events wait in a list of at most MAX_BACKLOG (past it, the list is let go and the page is sent a snapshot
 *                 alone when it drains), and its coalesced events only as the latest per market. What waited goes out in the order it was
 *                 emitted — by its seq, account events and the market's latest together — so the ids a page hears only ever rise, and
 *                 the last one it heard is always one it may resume from without missing an account event. Nothing grows without a bound
 *   closing       end() ends every stream open and lets go of every timer, so a server that closes (and a test) is never held open by
 *                 one; a page that goes away is let go at once
 *
 * Before any page has listened, nothing is kept: emit() returns at once (a page's first stream is sent a snapshot in any case), so a process
 * no page watches pays nothing for it. Nothing here reads or writes the account: it only carries what it is given. */
