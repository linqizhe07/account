/** THE DESK: the account's own agents, hired on the page — for the owner who has no agent of their own to connect, as the paper account
 * is for the owner who has no venue to connect. Eight seats, a charter each, one room, one objective, the approval line, the routines; a
 * live view of the run (the equity, the open leads, the tape of closes, the biggest ones). Shaped after the "eight agents run my desk"
 * pattern (a coordinator that never trades, specialists that find, clear, enter, exit and watch, one message format with a lead id at
 * every stage, reversible work done alone and signing done on approval) and after a perps bot's live screen (LIVE hh:mm of the session, the
 * equity and its curve, the position with its entry and take-profit lines, the trade tape, the big closes).
 *
 * The rule that makes it the ACCOUNT's desk and not a bot beside it: every seat is an agent key let in by the owner (approveAgent), and a
 * seat that trades does so inside a trading limit the owner signed (approveSpend), through the same door as any outside agent — Guard: a
 * card the owner answers; Beast: inside the limit, at once. CHARTERS BECOME LIMITS: the roles that must never trade (Head, Search, Risk,
 * Flow, Sentiment) hold no trading limit, so the door refuses them an order whatever they decide; the roles that trade (Sniper, Exit,
 * Watch) are bounded by the limit's size per order, its budget and its venues, and by the objective's own rules this file keeps (the most at
 * risk per lead, the day's loss at which the floor halts). The words in a charter steer the brain; they are not authority.
 *
 * A seat is HOUSE — the account runs it, with a brain — or OUTSIDE. The brains are every provider the account knows at once (brains.ts:
 * Claude through the Anthropic API, brain-claude.ts; OpenAI, DeepSeek, Grok, Muse, Kimi, Qwen, OpenRouter, Gemini, Groq, Together, a
 * local Ollama or vLLM, an endpoint the owner names — each its own OpenAI-format brain, brain-openai.ts; a scripted one in tests), each
 * with its own key, and the hired one thinks: a desk hired with a provider the account does not hold is said not to have a brain, and
 * no other is ever asked — or billed — in its place. OUTSIDE: an agent of the owner's own (Claude Code over MCP, any program with a key)
 * holding the seat: it reads the desk and its charter (portfolio_desk) and says things in the room (portfolio_desk_say, a signed
 * agentDeskSay). The two kinds are the same seat at the door; the Flow and Sentiment seats are outside-only, since they need data the
 * account does not have (a wallet-flow feed, a sentiment feed) and the account never pretends to.
 *
 * What a cycle does (every `everyMin` minutes while the session runs, or when the owner asks for one): the leads' orders are read back
 * from the account (fills, cards answered); EXIT reviews the open leads — the plan closes a lead at its take-profit, its stop or its time
 * limit without asking anyone, before the brain is asked anything, and the brain may then close one early; SEARCH reads Markets (the account's own listing of what the desk's venue
 * trades, movers and the most traded) and names leads; RISK checks each one — the market open, a price and a book, the spread, the day's
 * loss room, the size (the least of the objective's risk per lead, the Sniper's limit per order and what is left of its budget) — and
 * clears or rejects it; SNIPER places each cleared lead as the account's agentLiveOrder — at a paper account with the plan's take-profit
 * and stop as its bracket, so the paper account acts on them the moment the price reaches them; HEAD writes the cycle line, halts the floor when
 * the day's loss reaches the objective's line, and writes the evening report at the hour the objective names (and the weekly review on
 * Sundays). Between cycles the clock's every tick (30 s) reads the orders back and judges the plan's exits again — numbers, no brain — so a
 * stop never waits for the next cycle. Every step is a message in the room with the lead's id. Nothing in the room is invented: the account's reads, the door's
 * answers, the brain's words (said to be the brain's).
 *
 * The brain's cost is counted from the API's own token counts at the model's listed price — or the price the owner gives for a model no
 * list carries; without one the tokens are counted, unpriced — and shown as an estimate; without a brain
 * (no key) the desk is hired, its seats stand, and the room says so each cycle — no lead is made up.
 *
 * THE SUPERAGENT is this same desk at a paper account, trading on its own. In Guard every order an agent asks for waits for the owner on a
 * card, and Guard is the whole account's: so on paper the desk's orders would all be cards. The owner may sign one narrower thing instead
 * (setDesk `autonomy` {paper: true}): the desk's own house seats that trade, at the desk's venue, while that venue is a paper account, have
 * their orders placed at once — inside each seat's trading limit, as Beast would place them, and nothing else changes: an outside agent,
 * a key that holds no seat, another venue, a real-money venue, an order over the seat's limit are answered exactly as before. The door asks
 * this file (autonomyFor) and checks the venue is paper itself (live-orders.ts agent() and close()); the ledger row says the superagent
 * placed it. The desk refuses to move to a real-money venue while it is on. The owner may also sign it in the hire itself (hire's value
 * `autonomy`), so a desk started from the floor's Start never runs a moment, nor its first cycle, without it.
 *
 * What the floor draws comes from here too, and only from what the desk did: which seat is working on what right now and how many brain
 * calls are under way (in memory, gone on a restart), how long each role's last call took, the very table Search's brain was shown and what
 * it picked (the last scan, kept in the file), Search's confidence and Risk's hard-check numbers on each lead, and the room's new lines
 * since the page's last look (feed: the room's tail only, cheap enough to ask every second).
 *
 * Files: <home>/desk/desk.json (the desk: objective, seats, session, leads, equity points, reports, spend, the last scan, the autonomy)
 * and <home>/desk/room.jsonl
 * (the room, one message a line), the user's alone (0600), the first written whole each time (a temporary file, then a rename). The
 * seats' keys are in <home>/seats/desk-<role>.json (keystore.ts). The home is the trust boundary, as for the ledger. That folder is
 * shared with the MCP seats, which name their key file after the client's own name — so the "desk" names in it are the desk's alone, and an
 * outside client whose name would land on one is given a key file of its own beside them (outsideSeatFile).
