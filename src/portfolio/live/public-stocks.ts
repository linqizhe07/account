/** US STOCKS WITHOUT A KEY: real-time quotes where a keyless source gives them — Robinhood's, else Nasdaq's (us-quotes.ts) — and Cboe's own
 * delayed quotes where neither answers in time, so the Markets screen's Stocks tab — and a paper account — have real US stock prices before
 * any broker is connected. Read-only: nothing is traded through this listing; a US stock trades at a connected broker (Alpaca, Robinhood:
 * "Connect to trade") or in a paper account, which fills at these quotes by its own declared rule (paper.ts). The source keeps the id
 * "cboe" (US_STOCKS_ID): paper books already name it as the source of what they hold.
 *
 * Every line says which source priced it and how far behind that source is (quoteFrom: "Robinhood · real time",
 * "Nasdaq · real time", "Cboe · 15 min delayed"), with the price's own time as its source stamps it (quoteAt) and the delay (delayMs: 0, or
 * Cboe's fifteen minutes): a paper account judges a fill by them, never by the clock alone. The price, bid and ask on a line are all one
 * source's. A listing asks the real-time chain and Cboe AT THE SAME TIME: the chain is waited for RT_WAIT_MS at most (us-quotes.ts), Nasdaq
 * only for the first NASDAQ_AT_ONCE lines Robinhood did not price — the ticker typed whole first — and every other line is Cboe's.
 *
 * The DAY'S CHANGE on a line (change24h, changePct24h) is the change of the line's price from the last regular-session close before the
 * price's own time — yesterday's close in pre-market and the regular session, today's in after-hours — so the price less the change is that
 * close: Nasdaq's own figure (primaryData); for a Robinhood line, its price less Cboe's previous close (prev_day_close), and only while
 * Cboe's file is from the regular session the quote is in (DAY_CHANGE_FROM_CBOE: from Cboe's first trade of the day, about 09:45 New York,
 * to the close; in pre-market, after-hours and overnight the close it would be measured from is one Cboe's file does not say for certain,
 * and none is said); for a Cboe line, Cboe's own (price_change, from prev_day_close), only where Cboe gives a previous close.
 *
 * What is read from Cboe, and what it is (cboe.com's own quote pages read the same files; checked keyless from this machine 2026-10-13, 14:00
 * UTC, and 2026-10-14 17:49 UTC):
 *   GET cdn-api.cboe.com/api/global/delayed_quotes/quotes/{symbol}.json      one stock or ETF: {timestamp, data: {symbol, security_type
 *                       (stock | index), current_price, price_change, price_change_percent (both the DAY's, from prev_day_close), bid, ask,
 *                       bid_size, ask_size, open, high, low, close, prev_day_close, volume (shares), last_trade_time}}, about 520 bytes.
 *                       `timestamp` is when Cboe wrote the file, in UTC; `last_trade_time` is New York time with no zone written, FIFTEEN
 *                       MINUTES behind the market (14:00:46 UTC beside a last trade at 09:45:44 New York, which is 13:45 UTC): the delay is
 *                       Cboe's, said on every line it prices. A symbol Cboe does not list answers HTTP 403 from the store behind the CDN
 *                       (an XML AccessDenied, not a refusal of this network): read as "not listed". But the store also keeps files of
 *                       tickers that no longer trade: SATS.json (2026-10-14) is dated "2026-09-26 14:14:54", last_trade_time
 *                       "2026-06-23T15:59:59", current_price 103.3, prev_day_close 0.0 and bid and ask 0.0 — EchoStar's share trades as
 *                       ECHO — so a ticker the loaded symbol book does not list is not asked of Cboe (Nasdaq, which knows the tickers that
 *                       trade, is), and a change is taken only beside a previous close. A dotted class share is written with its dot (BRK.B).

 * latest session in minutes, five sessions in five minutes, a month of hours with pre-market and after-hours, three of the regular session —
 * folded into 15m and 4h; Robinhood's daily bars for a year or five, Nasdaq's by dates for all of it and for every page scrolled left, today's
 * bar built from the session's minutes ("Today so far"), weeks folded from days; Cboe's days where both refuse. Every page says its source, that
 * its prices are split-adjusted and not dividend-adjusted, which hours it covers, and each night it has no bars of ("No overnight data").
 * Where Robinhood does not answer the minutes, the latest session's minutes of both Cboe and Nasdaq, asked at once and merged by time: Cboe's
 * real minute bars wherever Cboe has the minute (the regular session, to fifteen minutes ago), and Nasdaq's one-price-a-minute SAMPLES
 * (us-quotes.ts Nasdaq.chart: open, high, low and close the same, no volume) for the minutes Cboe has none of — pre-market, the last fifteen
 * minutes of a session under way, after-hours. A bar with any sampled minute in it understates its range, and carries no volume (a bar's
 * volume is said only where every minute in it has one); the page names both sources. Only what each source says is carried. Cboe's volume
 * is in shares, so no dollar volume is said (nothing here is estimated). The trading session is the account's own US market calendar
 * (account/calendar.ts usSessionFull): the regular session 09:30–16:00 New York on market days (13:00 on an early close), and which phase is on
 * — pre-market, after-hours, overnight — with whether a limit order may be sent for it (extendedHours): in pre-market and after-hours where a
 * real-time source priced the line (a paper account fills only at a quote stamped in the phase that is on, and Cboe's never is); overnight
 * only where Robinhood priced it, its 24-hour market, while ROBINHOOD_OVERNIGHT says so. The source carries the calendar's clock
 * (`sessions`) for a paper account to judge a quote's own time by. Out of the regular session the line says so, and says when a real-time
 * price is not from the phase that is on.
 *
 * A LINE THE CHAIN PRICED NEVER WAITS FOR CBOE (feat/paper-live phase 3): Cboe is asked beside the chain, and waited for only for the lines
 * the chain did not price; the previous close beside a Robinhood price is taken where Cboe has already answered, and the day's change is
 * left out where it has not (the next read has it). ONE SHARE'S LINE (line: a paper account pricing a share it knows) asks the chain and
 * Cboe for that share alone — one GET of Cboe at most, where a search of a short ticker reads forty — and THE BACKGROUND READER (feed:
 * live/us-quotes.ts UsQuoteFeed) reads the shares someone is looking at as Robinhood and Nasdaq write them, sharing this line's one answer of
 * each; usLineAt says a line again at the reader's newer quote.
 *
 * Every GET goes through the fixed-host guard (public-markets.ts PUBLIC_HOSTS); a 451, a 429, an edge's 403 page or no answer from Cboe is
 * its answer for the whole listing when no real-time source priced anything either, held back as any public source's is (holdBackMs). */
