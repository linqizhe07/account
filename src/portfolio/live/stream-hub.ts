/** THE MARKET-DATA HUB (feat/paper-live, phase 2): the venues' own public WebSocket streams, read without a key and kept in memory, for the
 * markets someone is looking at now — a paper account's resting orders and positions (live/paper.ts: each look renews its interest) and the
 * markets a page on the push channel shows (service.ts followMarkets) — so a paper fill, a stop's trigger, a perpetual's mark and the page's
 * quote are the venue's price of this moment, not a listing a minute old. Nothing is written anywhere and nothing goes to a store of ours:
 * what a stream says lives here while its market is wanted, and a minute after, and goes.
 *
 *   the venues     four, each ONE WebSocket for every market wanted there, keyless, the message shapes as checked live on 2026-10-16
 *                  (.claude/paper-live/paperlive-audit.md, "Report: streams"):
 *                    Hyperliquid   wss://api.hyperliquid.xyz/ws — bbo (the best bid and ask with their sizes, each block they change),
 *                                  trades, activeAssetCtx (the mark, the oracle and the hourly funding, about once a second: a perpetual is
 *                                  marked and liquidated at its markPx), candle (the live one-minute bar), and l2Book {fast: true} (five
 *                                  levels about every half second) while a page shows the book. It closes a connection that sends nothing
 *                                  for sixty seconds: {"method":"ping"} goes at least every KEEPALIVE_MS, and whenever the connection has
 *                                  said nothing for QUIET_PING_MS — its pong says the connection still carries, so a quiet market's last
 *                                  price is still its price
 *                    Coinbase      wss://advanced-trade-ws.coinbase.com (Advanced Trade, no `jwt`) — ticker (the last trade and the best bid
 *                                  and ask with their sizes — but only when a trade happens: "price updates on every match, batched during
 *                                  cascading matches", its docs say, so on a quiet pair its best bid and ask are as old as its last trade),
 *                                  market_trades, heartbeats (one a second: a channel with nothing to say is closed after a minute or so
 *                                  without them), and level2 (it answers as l2_data: a snapshot, then each level's new size, 0 for gone)
 *                                  while a page shows the book — every change of the book, so while it is kept its top is the market's best
 *                                  bid and ask. Its sequence_num rises by one a message on a connection: a gap sends for the book afresh (at
 *                                  most once in RESYNC_MS)
 *                    Kraken        wss://ws.kraken.com/v2 — ticker with event_trigger "bbo" (every change of the best bid or ask), trade, ohlc
 *                                  (one-minute bars), and book at depth 10 while a page shows it: each book message's CRC32 of the top ten is
 *                                  checked against the book kept here, its prices and sizes written at the pair's own precision as its
 *                                  instrument channel says it (krakenChecksum), and a book that differs is sent for afresh. It sends a
 *                                  heartbeat every second by itself; {"method":"ping"} goes at least every KEEPALIVE_MS
 *                    OKX           wss://ws.okx.com:8443/ws/v5/public — bbo-tbt (the best bid and ask, tick by tick), tickers (the last price,
 *                                  at once on subscribing), trades, and books5 (five levels, whole each time) while a page shows the book. It
 *                                  closes a connection silent for thirty seconds: the text 'ping' goes whenever it has said nothing for
 *                                  QUIET_PING_MS (its answer is the text 'pong')
 *                  Binance and Bybit have no stream here, ever: their REST refuses this network from where the account was built (HTTP 451,
 *                  a CloudFront 403), and their market data from another host (data-stream.binance.vision, Bybit's WebSocket) would be the
 *                  way around a venue's own rule that the account never takes. A US share has no stream here either: its real-time quotes
 *                  are Robinhood's and Nasdaq's REST answers, read as they are written by the background reader beside this hub
 *                  (live/us-quotes.ts UsQuoteFeed), the two joined as one (joinHubs)
 *   which market  a market as a public source lists it (public-markets.ts), by that source's id and its own symbol, is streamed by that
 *                  source's own venue only (streamOf): Coinbase's BTC/USD as BTC-USD, Kraken's BTC/USD as BTC/USD, OKX's BTC/USDT as
 *                  BTC-USDT, Hyperliquid's BTC-PERP as BTC and a HIP-3 market's io:ANTH-PERP as io:ANTH — a market's listing source alone: a
 *                  stream stands only for the same source's REST read, never for another venue's market of the same name
 *   interest       a market is streamed while it is wanted: HELD by a page that shows it (hold → its release; `book` its book too), or
 *                  WANTED by the paper account for IDLE_MS from its last look (want). Once nothing wants it any more it is let go IDLE_MS
 *                  later (its book likewise, apart). At most MAX_MARKETS are streamed at once: one more is not (it stays on REST, its age
 *                  said), unless one no one wants any more can make room for it
 *   what is kept   per market: the best bid and ask with their sizes, the last trade, a perpetual's mark, oracle and funding, the venue's
 *                  own time of the latest message (at), when it came here (recvAt), the latest moment the stream confirmed its best bid and
 *                  ask (seenAt: where the venue's best-bid-and-ask channel speaks on every change of them — BBO_EVERY_CHANGE — a heartbeat or
 *                  a pong later on the same connection says nothing changed in between, a socket carrying its messages in order; Coinbase's
 *                  ticker does not, so its best bid and ask are confirmed only by its own next word, or by its level2 book while one is kept),
 *                  the venue's own moment of that best bid and ask (priceAt: their channel's stamp, or the book's where its top stands for
 *                  them — never another channel's, nor this machine's clock where the venue stamps nothing), a seq that rises with every
 *                  message (one count for every market of the hub: a market let go and taken again goes on from above where it stood, so a
 *                  judge's place in its trades never points past them); the book's levels while it is shown (its
 *                  top BOOK_TOP read out); the last RING_SIZE trades, each with the seq it came under and whether it came in a
 *                  subscription's snapshot (the paper account judges a resting order against their highest and lowest since it last looked:
 *                  since(), so a touch between two quotes is still a touch — ordered by seq alone, a snapshot's trades cut by the venue's
 *                  stamp); the live one-minute bar where the venue streams one. What a subscription said of the market now — its best bid
 *                  and ask, a perpetual's mark — goes with it (the connection lost, the market subscribed again): nothing of it stands until
 *                  the venue says it again
 *   live           a market is LIVE only while its connection has spoken in the last LIVE_MS and the venue's best-bid-and-ask channel has
 *                  spoken since the market was subscribed (each venue sends its snapshot then; a trade, the mark or the bar coming first is
 *                  not it): otherwise its price is said with its true age, and the paper account reads REST instead. A change of it is told
 *                  (a "live" tick)
 *   reconnects     a connection that closes, errs, stays silent past DEAD_MS or does not open within OPEN_MS is opened again after a
 *                  jittered wait between BACKOFF_MIN_MS and BACKOFF_MAX_MS (the ceiling doubling with each try, back to the shortest once
 *                  one carries a message), and every market still wanted is subscribed again. A clock that jumped — the hub's own look
 *                  every LOOK_MS came SLEEP_MS late: the Mac slept, and its sockets died without a word — opens every connection again, one
 *                  after another (STAGGER_MS apart), and no market is live until its stream speaks again
 *   location       a venue is streamed only while its REST answers this network (`answers(venue)`: the service's own read cache says the
 *                  venue's keyless listing answered and nothing holds it back): a venue whose REST is refused here — its place rule, an
 *                  edge, a ban — has its stream closed with it, and opened only once its REST answers again. No other host is ever tried
 *   lazy           nothing runs until a market is wanted: no socket, no timer — so a server starts listening without waiting on any of it.
 *                  close() ends every connection and every timer
 *
 * The hub only listens: it never sends a venue anything but its subscriptions and its keepalive, and no key, no order, nothing signed. */
