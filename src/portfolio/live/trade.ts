/** TRADING at a venue connected live: the markets it lists, an order, and what became of it.
 *
 * Every venue speaks its own language — an exchange's unified library, a broker's REST API, a prediction market's signed orders, a DEX
 * aggregator's transaction for the user's own wallet. This file is the one shape the account sees all of them through:
 *
 *   markets(query)      what can be traded there that matches a few letters
 *   market(symbol)      one market, with a fresh price, the smallest order, the steps of size and price, whether it takes orders now,
 *                       and — a stock — the venue's trading session (in session now, when it next opens or closes)
 *   place(order)        one order, at the venue, with the account's id for it (the venue's idempotency key, where it takes one):
 *                       market, limit, stop (a market order once a trigger price is reached) or stop-limit, with the time in force,
 *                       post-only and reduce-only flags the venue takes in that market
 *   cancel / status     what became of it: open, partly filled, filled, canceled, rejected
 *   amend               an open order changed in place — its size, its limit, its stop — where the venue can
 *   positions / close   what is held there (perpetuals, shares, event contracts), and a position closed at the venue
 *   setLeverage         a perpetual's leverage and margin mode, where the venue lets it be set
 *
 * A trader offers only what its venue really takes: an option a market does not list (`types`, `tifs`, `postOnly`, `reduceOnly`) is
 * refused by the account before the venue is asked, and a method a trader does not have is a door the account says is closed there.
 *
 * Nothing here decides WHETHER an order is placed. The account's door does that (account/live-orders.ts): the server's switch and cap, the
 * owner's signature or the agent's limit, the mode. A trader only speaks the venue's language, and its refusal is the venue's own.
 *
 * Every market is priced in DOLLARS (USD or a dollar stablecoin), so that a cap and a budget mean dollars; a market priced in something
 * else is not offered.
