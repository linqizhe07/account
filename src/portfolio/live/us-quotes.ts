/** US STOCK QUOTES IN REAL TIME, KEYLESS: the price of a US share as the market has it now, so a listing (public-stocks.ts) — and a paper
 * account, which fills at it — is not fifteen minutes behind. Two sources, each through the fixed-host guard (public-markets.ts
 * PUBLIC_HOSTS); where neither answers in time, the caller says Cboe's delayed quote, which it asks AT THE SAME TIME, not after.
 *
 * What is read, and what it is (checked keyless from this machine on Wed 2026-10-14 between 16:30 and 17:50 UTC, 12:30–13:50 New York, in
 * the regular session):
 *   GET api.robinhood.com/rhj/prices                                ROBINHOOD's prices for its Stock Tokens, ALL of them in one answer (194
 *                       that day, 98.7 KB, 0.17–0.35 s at 17:49 UTC, 1.4 s once earlier): {quotes: [{tokenSymbol, bid, ask, currency,
 *                       isTradingHalt, generatedAt, dailyHigh, dailyLow, dailyTradingVolume, tokenBid, tokenAsk, …}]}. The record names the
 *                       share only by `tokenSymbol`, which is the TOKEN's symbol and NOT ALWAYS the share's ticker: 193 of the 194 matched
 *                       Cboe's symbol book by ticker and company (twelve also checked against Nasdaq's quote the same minute, each bid and
 *                       ask within a cent), but SATS is EchoStar's token (/rhj/assets: tokenName "EchoStar • Robinhood Token", isin
 *                       US2787681061) while EchoStar's share trades as ECHO — Nasdaq answers SATS "Symbol not exists.", Cboe's book lists
 *                       ECHO and not SATS, and Robinhood's SATS bid and ask (87.87/87.93 at 17:49 UTC) are ECHO's. So a Robinhood quote is
 *                       taken only for a ticker the caller says the market lists under that name (UsAsk.listed: Cboe's symbol book).
 *                       `bid` and `ask` are the UNDERLYING SHARE's quote, in dollars; `tokenBid` and `tokenAsk` are the token's (the share's
 *                       times the token's multiplier, 1.0011 for CRM that day) and are not read. `generatedAt` is the answer's own stamp,
 *                       ONE for all 194 quotes: Robinhood writes the whole answer about every fifteen seconds (16:51:47, 16:52:02, 16:52:17,
 *                       16:52:32 UTC that day; 17:49:28 and 17:49:43 later) and serves the same one in between, whether or not a quote in
 *                       it moved — it says the writer is running, not how old a quote is. So a share's quote is stamped with the
 *                       generatedAt of the FIRST answer in which its bid and ask stood as they stand now ("unchanged since"), never the
 *                       latest answer's: a book that stops moving ages, and is passed over after FRESH_MS. Since when a book has stood is
 *                       known only from an answer that saw it move: a book FIRST SEEN — after a restart, when nothing was read before — is
 *                       not taken until it moves while watched (it may have stood since the last session: Friday's book, read on Sunday
 *                       night), and one that moved across answers that were not read is stamped with the last answer read before them,
 *                       the earliest it may have moved (ROBINHOOD_NEXT_MS). A share Robinhood has halted
 *                       (`isTradingHalt` true) is left out. Only these 194 are quoted (no JPM, BRK.B, V, WMT or HOOD); a symbol asked one at
 *                       a time (/rhj/prices/{SYM}) is not asked here — the one answer serves them all. Robinhood's assets list (/rhj/assets)

 *                       for at most a thousand symbols, shared by the quote and the chart); a symbol neither knows is not listed (kept ten
 *                       minutes). A dotted class share is written with its dot (BRK.B). Nasdaq's book (bidPrice, askPrice) is NASDAQ's own,

 *                       values a paper book
 *
 * The chain (usQuote), with ONE deadline (RT_WAIT_MS) for all of it: Robinhood's quote for a symbol it quotes and the caller says is listed
 * under that ticker, while its stamp is fresh (FRESH_MS) and the session is one it trades (pre-market, the regular session, after-hours — and
 * overnight while ROBINHOOD_OVERNIGHT says so); else Nasdaq's, in pre-market, the regular session and after-hours, for at most one batch
 * (NASDAQ_AT_ONCE) of the symbols asked, the first ones; else nothing, and the caller says Cboe's delayed quote. Nasdaq is asked AT THE SAME
 * TIME as Robinhood, never after it: for every symbol Robinhood's latest answer does not price fresh now (each of them, before Robinhood has
 * answered once), so a share Robinhood does not quote waits for one round trip, not two. What has not answered by the deadline is not waited
 * for: its answer, when it comes, is KEPT UNTIL THE NEXT ASK, which takes it whenever a new one is not back in time — a Nasdaq answer comes in
 * 1.2 to 3.3 s (measured 2026-10-16), past the deadline more often than not, and one thrown away at the next ask's start would never be used.
 * It is taken only WHILE IT IS RECENT (Nasdaq.latest): it came within FRESH_MS, and no refusal that says to wait holds Nasdaq back now — an
 * answer from hours before, or from before Nasdaq refused, is no real-time quote, and the line is Cboe's, said as delayed.
 * One refusal of Nasdaq that says to wait (an edge's page, a place rule, a 429) holds back every Nasdaq ask, every symbol, quote and chart, for
 * as long as holdBackMs says; NO ANSWER holds nothing until it is the source's way (NO_ANSWER_HOLD_AFTER in a row, with no answer between): one
 * slow request is one symbol's lost ask, not every share's twenty seconds. Robinhood's one answer likewise. Every answer carries the source's
 * own stamp (`at`), how far behind it is (`delayMs`: 0 for both) and which it is in words (`from`); nothing is worked out but Robinhood's price,
 * the middle of its bid and ask. These are the websites' own unofficial endpoints, not a licensed feed: either may change or refuse without
 * notice, which is why the delayed fallback stays.
 *
 * THE BACKGROUND READER (UsQuoteFeed, feat/paper-live phase 3): the shares someone is looking at now — a paper account's open orders and what
 * it holds (live/paper.ts renews its want at each look), the shares a page on the account's push channel shows (service.ts) — read as their
 * sources write them, in memory only, and told to whoever listens as they move: Robinhood's one answer read just after each of its writes
 * (robinhoodQuotes nextWrite: the window on this machine's clock in which its next write shows, learnt from the answers themselves — a
 * read that still has the write before raises its floor, the first with the new one ends it, the next a cadence on — and read halfway into
 * it until it is narrow, then at its end. Robinhood wrote at 04:35:19.07, 04:35:34.18 and 04:35:49.14 UTC on Saturday 2026-10-17, 15.1 s and
 * 15.0 s apart, each read in 59–95 ms: an answer is read within ROBINHOOD_PRECISE_MS of its write, with one or two reads a write, instead of
 * anywhere up to ten seconds after it; a write that does not come — Robinhood late, or its writer stopped — asked for again a few times
 * quickly, then less and less often, a cadence apart at most, until a new one is read), and Nasdaq every NASDAQ_EVERY_MS for each wanted
 * share Robinhood does not price young (ROBINHOOD_STANDS_MS). It stands beside the venues' streams (live/stream-hub.ts) as one more
 * MarketHub, for the US stocks line alone: its quotes are the same REST reads, never a stream's, and say so (`from`; `everyMs`, how often
 * Robinhood writes its answer; `askedEveryMs`, how often the account asks Nasdaq, which writes nothing on a cadence of its own) */
