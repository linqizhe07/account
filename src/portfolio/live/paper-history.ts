/** A PAPER ACCOUNT'S PAST, told again from its own book.
 *
 * A paper account (paper.ts) is the account's own record: every order it ever filled is in its book (`book.orders` is never pruned — the
 * fills list keeps only the last 500, so the replay is not built from it), with the size filled, the price, the fee and when. So what the paper
 * account was worth at any moment since it started is KNOWN, not guessed: its cash is the starting money moved by each fill in turn, and
 * what it held is valued at the public sources' price bars between the fills. This module does that, and says which bars it needs
 * (paperBarsWanted), and nothing else: it is pure (no file, no network, no clock), the caller hands it the book and the bars and gets the
 * curve back.
 *
 * What is read, and what it is:
 *   the book     `PaperBook` (paper.ts): `createdAt` and `startCashUsd` (the start: that much cash, nothing held), every order whose
 *                `filledQty` is above zero, in the order of its fill time (`filledAt` where the book keeps one, else `updatedAt`: a filled
 *                order changes no more), at its `avgPrice` and its `feeUsd`; each market's kind and quote (every market a paper account trades is
 *                priced in dollars: one that is not — a book written by hand — is left out, and that is said) (`book.markets[symbol]`), and an event's settlement as its venue said it
 *                (`settled`: what a contract paid, and when the venue settled it); the funding each perpetual paid or received
 *                (`book.funding`, hour by hour, where the book keeps it) and each open position's own running total of it
 *                (`book.positions[symbol].fundingUsd`)
 *   the bars     `PriceSeries`: one symbol's bars at one interval (5m, 1h, 1d), oldest first, as the paper account's own `candles` passes
 *                them through from the market's source (public-markets.ts). A bar's close is known when the bar has closed — its start plus
 *                its interval, unless the series says otherwise (`closeAt`: a source whose daily bar is stamped at the session's open closes
 *                it at the session's end, not a day later)
 *
 * How the book moves, as fill() moves it (paper.ts):
 *   a holding    a coin, a share, a token, an event contract: a buy moves cash by −(qty × price + fee) and adds the qty; a sell by
 *                +(qty × price − fee) and takes it away. An event's settlement (an order the engine wrote, `settlement-…`) is a sell at
 *                what the venue paid
 *   a perpetual  the side, the size and the average entry kept exactly as fill() keeps them: an order on the position's side (or with none
 *                open) opens or adds, an order on the other side reduces it up to the position and never flips it. The margin put up is
 *                the paper account's own money still, so here it is counted as cash: opening moves cash by −fee only, reducing by
 *                +realised − fee, realised being (price − entry) × qty for a long and (entry − price) × qty for a short — and, the margin
 *                being all a position can lose, by the loss past it back again, as the order says it (`lossPastMarginUsd`). A liquidation
 *                (an order the engine wrote, `liquidation-…`) is a reduce at its price. Funding moves cash by what was paid, at its time
 *
 * What it is worth at a moment t: the cash, plus each holding's qty × its close at t, plus each perpetual's unrealised
 * profit at its close at t. The close at t is that of the latest bar whose close is known at or before t — of every series given for the
 * symbol, the bar that closed last; where two closed at the same moment, the finer one's (5m before 1h before 1d): a finer series that has
 * stopped (a venue that drops its no-trade bars, a window that ends) never stands over a coarser bar that closed after it. An event
 * contract its venue has settled is worth what the venue paid from the moment the venue says it settled (`settled.at`: Kalshi's
 * settlement_ts, Gamma's closedTime — the end of its oracle's resolution — both read live 2026-10-14), not its last bar, until the account
 * wrote the payout at its next look. No bar known yet: the last price the paper account traded that symbol at, at or before t — a price it
 * really traded at — and the point is marked partial, with the symbol in `missing`.
 *
 * The points: one at the book's start (its starting money) when that is inside the range — or, a book started before the range, one at the
 * range's start itself, valued as every point is, so that a curve and its change start where the account stood then and not at the grid's
 * first step after it — then one at every multiple of `stepMs` from the range's start (never before the book's start) to its end; when the
 * caller gives the live value now (`nowUsd`), the last point, at the range's end, is that — it has in it what the replay cannot see.
 * Rounded to cents.
 *
 * What it cannot know is said, in `inexact`, in plain sentences, never papered over — and only when it is so, with the book's own figure:
 * funding an open position paid that the book's list hour by hour does not have (its `fundingUsd` against the list), the loss past the
 * position's margin of a liquidation whose order does not say it (a book's from before it was written down: the margin rests on a leverage
 * the order does not keep), a symbol with no bars. And the replay checks itself against the book: the cash and
 * margin it ends with (any funding missing from the list shows here, with its size), and what it ends holding, on which side, against the
 * book's own — a difference is said, with its size.
