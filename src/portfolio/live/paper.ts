/** A PAPER ACCOUNT the account keeps itself (the connector live:paper): paper dollars, every market the public sources list, fills by the
 * account's own declared rule, a book in the home. Nothing to connect, so it is the account's way in for someone with no wallet, no
 * exchange account and no key: the first flight, with every door, limit, card and statement line the real thing has, and no money. It is
 * the account's own paper broker, as Alpaca's paper account is Alpaca's: US shares in every session the public quotes cover — pre-market,
 * the regular session, after-hours, overnight — coins and perpetuals around the clock, event contracts until they settle.
 *
 * What it is made of:
 *   prices    the public market data Markets reads without a key (public-markets.ts: the exchanges' tickers, Hyperliquid's perpetuals,
 *             Kalshi's, Polymarket's and Polymarket US's event contracts, Robinhood's Stock Tokens, xStocks at Gate and Ondo Stocks
 *             (public-rwa.ts), US stocks (public-stocks.ts: real-time quotes where a public source gives them, Cboe's delayed file
 *             behind them), the pre-IPO perpetuals). A market is listed here under the symbol its source lists it by (`BTC/USD` from
 *             Coinbase, `BTC-PERP` from Hyperliquid, `AAPL`, a Kalshi ticker); where two sources list the same symbol, the first in the
 *             sources' order speaks for it — the US stock line before Robinhood's Stock Tokens, so `NVDA` here is the share, not the token;
 *             and a coin pair COINBASE's where Coinbase lists it, else Kraken's, else OKX's (paperOrder: Coinbase's deep history, its keyless
 *             ticker with the best bid and ask). A market the book has traded is its source's alone: when that source does not answer, the
 *             market has no quote, and no other source's market of the same symbol stands in for it (a BTC/USD bought at Kraken stays
 *             Kraken's). A quote is, FIRST, the market's own venue's live stream (live/stream-hub.ts: Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, Hyperliquid —
 *             the best bid and ask of this moment, the last trade, a perpetual's mark and funding) while it is live, over the listing its
 *             source last gave (what the market is: its name, its steps, its leverage, whether it takes orders); else the source's listing
 *             as the service and the source keep it, as old as the moment its venue answered. Every quote says its moment (quoteAt — the
 *             moment the stream last confirmed it, a stock's own stamp, else when its venue answered, public-markets.ts readAtOf) and where
 *             it came from (quoteFrom: "Coinbase · live", "Kraken · order book", the source), and a stock's carries its source's delay too
 *   orders    market, limit, stop (a market order once the price reaches the stop), stop-limit (a limit order once it does) and trailing
 *             stop (a stop a percent or a price behind the best price since it was placed, moving with it) — an event contract takes
 *             market and limit orders only; a time in force of good-till-canceled, immediate-or-cancel or fill-or-kill (the same thing
 *             here: nothing fills in part — a market order of anything but a stock takes fill-or-kill alone, so it never promises a part
 *             filled), and for a stock DAY, which ends with the market's session (the regular one's close, or the
 *             extended one's for an order sent for extended hours), a stock's default; and a BRACKET: an entry with its exits, a
 *             take-profit limit and a stop-loss stop placed the moment it fills, the one that fills canceling the other. Exits go with
 *             their position: canceled once it is closed, sold, liquidated or settled (on a perpetual, every reduce-only order with them),
 *             and one larger than what is left closes what is left
 *   fills     the account's OWN RULE, said everywhere it shows: a market order fills at once, whole, at the ask (a buy) or the bid (a sell)
 *             — a size the best level does not hold WALKS THE BOOK, level by level, at the average of what it took (the stream's book, or
 *             the order book its source gives, read for it — the source's own where the stream's top levels do not hold it), and one the
 *             book does not hold within the worst price the account's door gave it fills nothing (no partial fills), nor one whose source
 *             has a book that did not answer — inside that worst price; a COIN OR A PERPETUAL fills, triggers and rests only at a bid and
 *             an ask at most FILL_FRESH_MS old: its stream's, else its source's order book read now (as old as BOOK_FRESH_MS from when its
 *             venue answered), else nothing, and the order is refused (or waits) saying why — a listing that gives the last trade only
 *             (Coinbase's, Hyperliquid's mid) is no such price; a market whose source has neither a stream nor a book (a pre-IPO venue's
 *             contract) fills at its listing, whose age the fill says. A limit order that crosses the quote when it is placed fills at
 *             once at the
 *             quote (where that is better than its limit), one that rests fills at its limit when the quote reaches it (a bracket's
 *             take-profit beyond its entry's fill rests from the moment it is placed; a stock's rest lasts the session it rested in, and
 *             no further) — and one that never rested (past the quote the moment
 *             it was changed, triggered, placed as a bracket's exit after a gap, or let back into its session or out of a halt) takes the
 *             quote as one crossing when placed does; a stop triggers when the bid (a sell) or the ask (a buy) reaches
 *             it. A market its source says takes no orders now (a halt, a contract no longer active) fills nothing. Resting orders are judged
 *             ON EACH TICK of their market's live stream (onTick: that market's orders only, against the quote of that moment AND the
 *             highest and lowest trade since each was last judged — a stop the price touched between two quotes has triggered, and fills at
 *             its stop or past it where the price is past it now; a resting limit the trades reached fills at its limit), and whenever the
 *             account looks — a read, a poll, the positions, and the service's own look every few seconds, the sweep that ends days, pays
 *             funding, settles events and, after the machine slept — or the service was not running: the book keeps when it was last looked at
 *             (lookedAt) — judges the time it slept against its markets' own real bars, one-minute ones where they reach back to it, and only
 *             where they cover the whole of it (catchUp); a market whose bars do not come back whole is owed that time, judged at no quote
 *             meanwhile and asked again at the next look, and no tick of the streams judges anything while the time asleep is unjudged. No
 *             partial fills, no queue. What an open order may need is HELD (P1): a buy's cash at its price (its limit, its
 *             stop, its worst) with its fee, a perpetual's margin and fee where it would open or add, a plain sell's units of the holding —
 *             an order whose need is not free is refused when it is placed, and a fill takes nothing another open order holds.
 *             A STOCK fills only at a REAL-TIME quote (Robinhood's or Nasdaq's: never Cboe's, fifteen minutes behind the market — a
 *             market order whose only quote is Cboe's is refused, saying so, and the market says it before the order is prepared:
 *             Market.refusesNow; a limit waits for a real-time quote) stamped inside a session the order trades in, while its market is in
 *             that session as its source sees it: the regular session for every order; pre-market, after-hours and overnight (New York)
 *             for a limit order sent for extended hours where the market's session takes one. An order placed now takes a real-time quote
 *             as old as the US line takes one (us-quotes.ts FRESH_MS); an open order — a resting limit, a stop, a trailing stop, a market
 *             order queued for its session — is judged only at one STOCK_JUDGE_MS old at most, and on each word of the US shares'
 *             background reader (us-quotes.ts UsQuoteFeed: Robinhood read as it writes, Nasdaq beside it) as the venues' streams' ticks
 *             judge a coin's. A quote older than its source's delay and QUOTE_GRACE_MS fills nothing. A share the book knows is priced by
 *             its line alone (PublicSource.line: one GET of Cboe at most, never a search of its ticker). A market order out of the session
 *             is QUEUED for it (as a broker holds
 *             one for the open), and at its session's first real-time quote fills inside the worst price signed, taken afresh from that
 *             quote but never past the signed one — an open past it cancels it, nothing filled; one sent immediate-or-cancel is canceled
 *             instead; stops on a stock are watched in the regular session
 *             only. Charges: a US share none (no commission, as a broker charges none); everything else `feeBps` of the notional (0.10%)
 *   holdings  a coin, a token, a share or an event contract bought is held and sold only as far as it is held (no shorting them, no
 *             margin on them). A PERPETUAL is a position, long or short, with ISOLATED margin at
 *             the leverage set for the market (1x unless set, up to the most the market's source shows): the notional over the leverage
 *             is put up as margin, the unrealised profit is marked at the quote, a close (reduce-only, or the opposite side up to the
 *             position) realises it; the side is never flipped by one order. The margin is all a position can lose: a close past it gives
 *             nothing back and takes nothing from the cash, and a part closed past its own share of the margin takes the rest of its loss
 *             out of the margin of what is left. Each look marks the perpetuals before it judges the orders.
 *             FUNDING is paid or received out of the margin each whole hour the position stands, at the rate the source shows when the
 *             account looks, or when an order fills on the position before it moves it (Hyperliquid's rate is hourly; another venue's is
 *             for its eight-hour interval, so an eighth of it an hour), on
 *             the notional at the mark, the long paying when the rate is above zero; a market whose source shows no rate pays none.
 *             LIQUIDATION: when the margin left — the margin put up, less the loss and the funding paid — falls to the maintenance margin,
 *             half the initial margin at the market's most leverage (the notional at the mark over twice that leverage), the position is
 *             closed at the mark — a mark fresh enough to fill at, as every fill's price is (its venue's mark on its live stream, the middle
 *             of an order book read now; never a listing minutes old, never the book's last kept price), its source and age said — what is
 *             left of the margin after the fee goes back to cash, and the fill says "liquidated". At 1x a long
 *             cannot be liquidated; a short at 1x is, once the price has risen by a third (as at a venue that keeps that rule).
 *             An EVENT CONTRACT is marked at its price and, once its venue says the market has settled (public-markets.ts `settlement`),
 *             paid out at what its venue paid — $1 a contract to the side that won, nothing to the other — and taken off the book; a
 *             market that has closed and not settled is said to be waiting. A venue that does not say settlements never settles here
 *   the book  <home>/paper/<venue>/book.json, the user's alone (0600), rewritten atomically (a temp file renamed into place): before the
 *             owner's own instruction is answered; within FILL_SAVE_MS of a fill the stream or a look found (written in the background,
 *             never blocking the next tick), within TRAIL_SAVE_MS of a trailing stop's move; a look's change before the look ends. In it:
 *             cash, holdings (with what they cost), positions (with their leverage and the funding paid), the leverage set per market, every
 *             order that filled (the book's past is told again from them, paper-history.ts) — one closed with nothing filled (canceled,
 *             expired, rejected) more than PRUNE_AFTER_MS ago goes to the month's archive beside it, orders-YYYY-MM.json — the last 500 fills (a settlement, a liquidation and a
 *             bracket's exit are fills with a note), the funding settled hour by hour, the paper money its owner added, and each traded
 *             market's source. Connecting the same venue id again continues the book (the connect form says so first); another id is
 *             another account — several can be open at once, each its own venue. Its OWNER runs it, each by a signature
 *             (account/exchange.ts): paper money added to its cash (topUpPaper: written as put in, never a gain), or the account started
 *             again with a new sum (resetPaper: the book as it stands archived beside it as book-<the moment>.json, never deleted, and a
 *             new one in its place under the same id, its order numbers going on)
 *
 * The source says `paper: true` (types.ts): its balance is not money, its orders are rehearsals the door holds to the owner's signature or
 * an agent's limit and not to the server's cap, Markets keeps its line after every real venue's, the comparison leaves it out.
