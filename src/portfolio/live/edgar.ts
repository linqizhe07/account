/** SEC EDGAR, KEYLESS (after OpenStock's stock pages, which show a company's financials): a US company's own filed figures for the stock
 * drawer's Financials — revenue, net income, diluted earnings a share, shares outstanding — read from the SEC's XBRL "company facts", the
 * tagged numbers of every 10-K and 10-Q the company filed. Two GETs, each through the fixed-host guard (public-markets.ts fixedHosts),
 * their shapes as read on 2026-10-22:
 *   GET https://www.sec.gov/files/company_tickers.json                every listed company's ticker → CIK (10,428 rows, 780 KB that day):
 *                       {"0": {cik_str: 1045810, ticker: "NVDA", title: "NVIDIA CORP"}, "1": …}. A class share is written with a dash
 *                       (BRK-B) where the account writes a dot (BRK.B). Kept a day
 *   GET https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyfacts/CIK##########.json  every fact the company ever tagged (Apple: 3.8 MB): {cik, entityName,
 *                       facts: {"us-gaap": {<Concept>: {label, units: {USD: [{start?, end, val, accn, fy, fp, form, filed, frame?}]}}},
 *                       dei: {EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding: {units: {shares: [{end, val, …}]}}}}. A 10-Q carries its own quarter
 *                       (start to end about 91 days; `frame` CY2026Q2) and the year to date (start the fiscal year's first day); a 10-K the
 *                       fiscal year (about 365 days; frame CY2025). No fourth quarter is filed on its own, and none is worked out here. The
 *                       same period comes again in later filings as a comparative, under the later filing's fiscal year (Apple's third
 *                       quarter of 2025 in the third quarter's 10-Q of 2026, under fy 2026): one period is one row here, labelled and
 *                       valued by the filing that first reported it — an amendment of that same filing (10-K/A, 10-Q/A) winning over it.
 *                       Kept twelve hours
 * THE SEC'S FAIR-ACCESS RULE (sec.gov/os/accessing-edgar-data): at most ten requests a second, and a User-Agent that says who is asking and
 * how to reach them. It answers HTTP 403 — a "Request Rate Threshold Exceeded" page — to a reader without an address in its user agent
 * (checked from here 2026-10-22: a name and a repository URL alone were refused, a name with an address was answered). So the account
 * asks only with the contact the owner set (SEC_CONTACT, an email address) and says so where none is set: it never makes an address up
 * and never pretends to be a browser. A refusal is said in the SEC's own words (public-markets.ts publicNo) and held as any public
 * source's is (holdBackMs). Nothing here is estimated: a period the filings do not carry is not a row. */
