/* THE TRADE TERMINAL — the Trade pane laid out as Hyperliquid lays its own trading screen (app.hyperliquid.xyz/trade, measured in the
   scratchpad's hl-reference.md): dark panels three pixels apart on a lighter ground — the market bar over the chart on the left (the
   market, its price, its 24 hours, its funding or its session), the order book and the latest trades beside them (ui/book.js), the order
   panel on the right (the ticket, ui/trade.js), and under them what is held, what is open, what filled and every order placed; at the very
   foot a thin status strip (whether the account's stream is live — HL's own "Online" in the same corner, ui/stream.js stDot — which
   accounts trade from here, and a read of the bar's market that failed). The market is picked from the bar: it opens the kinds and their
   lists (the picker, ui/trade.js) in a popover laid over the panels, never pushing them down. What the account pushes — an order's state, a
   fill, a position — is drawn into the tabs under the panels as it comes (ttPushed), whatever is being typed in the ticket.

   Whether the owner trades here or watches the account's desk trade a paper account by itself is the topbar's switch (account.html
   #trade-mode, Regular · Superagent, shell.js): one switch for both panes, so this frame draws none of its own.

   The layout follows the terminal's own width, not the window's (container queries in terminal.css): three columns — the chart taking the
   rest, the book and the order panel the same width as each other — once the terminal is 1080 pixels wide; the chart over the order panel
   and the book side by side below that; and under 560 one column, the chart and the book sharing one panel behind three tabs (Chart ·
   Order book · Trades, as HL's phone layout has them) so the order panel follows directly. Both stay mounted; the tabs only hide one. At
   three columns the terminal fits the window as HL's does (ttFit): the grid sized from what sits outside it, the tables under it the rest,
   scrolling inside under their heads, the status strip at the window's foot — the page itself does not scroll at 1500 × 900. The bar's
   figures are shown whole or not at all (ttFitStats), and the tables' prices are written as their market writes them (ttFig).

   It draws nothing of its own about a market that its sources did not say: the bar's figures are the market's as its venue lists it
   (GET /api/account/market, read again every five seconds while the pane is showing — its beat goes on while another pane shows, asking
   nothing, so the figures are fresh again within a beat of coming back) and its row's — until an account is chosen for it, the row read
   again on the same beat; a figure no source gave is not shown, and a read that failed says so, with when the figures showing were read.
   Every button does what it says through the ticket, the book or the account's own door.

   PUSHED (feat/paper-live p2b). The tab follows on the account's stream exactly the markets it shows (ttFollow, ui/stream.js stFollow):
   the market the bar, the chart and the book show — whole: its quote, book and trades — and the markets of the positions listed under the
   panels while that tab shows — their price alone, each row's mark — and nothing while another pane shows (a hidden tab's stream is
   closed, so the account lets go of them all; ui/stream.js). Where the stream carries the market showing, its price, its bid and ask, its
   funding and its change (from the venue's own reference: the price read less its change) follow each pushed quote in the next frame, the
   price tinted by the way its last tick went, and the read of the market slows to a fallback once every TT_PUSHED_MS (its 24 hours' volume,
   its session and its steps are the read's); a position's mark, its value, its PNL and its ROE follow the pushed price of its market the
   same way, from the positions last read (nothing is asked for it). At the bar's right end the feed (ttFeed) says how the price showing
   comes — Live (pushed as its venue's stream moves), Quiet (the stream carries it and its venue is silent), Polling (read every few seconds:
   the stream is down, or does not carry this market) — and how old it is, every second; on hover, how long a pushed price takes to reach
   the screen (ui/stream.js stLag). A pushed price is never shown over a newer read, never as the price of a market picked after it (the
   bar is drawn the moment another market or venue is picked: ttLiveQuote), and one the stream no longer carries is never live. A word that
   the market is not live there brings the read forward to its own beat, and the next such word never puts it back (ttPollSooner). */

/* the terminal's state: the market showing (its Markets row and that row as last read again, where it is traded, the market as the venue
   lists it, when that was last read, why the last read failed and how many reads in a row have — the beat waits longer after each: ttWaitMs),
   how many positions the last read listed (said on their tab), the tab under the panels, the market the chart and the book were mounted
   on, whether a market has shown on this frame or a ticket was opened on purpose (from then on nothing picks one by itself: ui/trade.js
   tkTicket says so as a ticket opens, tkReopenDraft while a kept ticket's market is read), and the bar's read timer with when it is due
   (pollAt; 0 while none is set, or while its read is on its way) — and what the stream pushes: the market showing as it is followed
