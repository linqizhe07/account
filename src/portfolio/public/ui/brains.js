/* THE BRAINS (ui/brains.js): the one place where the owner picks what the desk's house seats think with, gives a provider its API key,
   names its model, tests it, and switches the desk over. Loaded before ui/desk.js and ui/superagent.js, which both open it, so the three
   ways in are the same sheet:
     the Superagent's header     its Brain stat is always a button ("Brain ›", the model, the calls, what they cost — or, when the brain
                                 cannot think, why, in amber); the sheet opens on the brain the desk uses now, its paste row (Connect a
                                 key, below) at the top — in focus while that brain cannot think
     the Superagent's setup      "3 · The brain" has "Brains: add a key, pick a model ›" (and each brain not ready its own "Type its key ›"):
                                 a key typed there shows at once in the setup's checklist, and "Pick it for the desk" puts the provider,
                                 the model, the effort and the price into the setup's form — what was typed there stays (core formKeep)
     the Agents pane             the hired desk's "Brain…", and the hiring form's "4 · The brain" (the same "Pick it for the desk" into it)
   openBrains(ctx) opens it. It wears the tokens of where it opens: the sheet is dialog#modal, which ui/tokens.css gives Hyperliquid's
   values while the trading area shows (html[data-area="trade"]) and the Account's on the Agents pane, so this file and ui/brains.css name
   only the Account's tokens (--surface, --text, --dim, --border …) and the shared classes (.btn, .tag, .msg, dialog label).

   WHAT IT READS. GET /api/account/desk/catalog: brains[], one per provider the account registered — its id, its label, its kind (a model
   API, one on this machine, a custom endpoint), its base URL, the models it suggests (and the date they were read), whether it is ready
   (ok, how) or why not (why, and the account's fix: the key file's path and a command), the key's masked tail where a key is saved ("…ab12",
   never the key), and whether a key in the account's environment is used before the file (envWins). What a provider entry does not carry
   is taken from BR_PRESETS below: each provider's own page for a key, its docs, and the model ids its own docs listed — every one read on
   the date BR_READ says, from the provider's own pages (scratchpad research brains-web.md, and the key pages checked again that day). A
   model list is a suggestion in a datalist, never the whole list: any id the endpoint serves can be typed.

   WHAT THE OWNER SIGNS, each with this browser's device key:
     setBrainKey { provider, baseUrl, model, keyHash, salt }   "Save the key". keyHash is hex SHA-256(salt ‖ key): the salt's 16 random
                                 bytes, then the key's UTF-8 bytes, hashed here with crypto.subtle when Save is pressed (never per
                                 keystroke); salt is those 16 bytes as 32 lowercase hex characters. The account keeps the provider, the
                                 base URL, the model and a fingerprint (keyHash's first 8 hex) — never the key, never its tail. Before
                                 anything leaves the page, a yes is asked over the sheet (brConfirmSave) that shows exactly those four —
                                 the provider, the base URL, the model, the fingerprint — and never the key: a "no" sends nothing at all,
                                 not even the hash. keyHash "" (and salt "") with no base URL and no model takes the key away — the
                                 provider's file under credentials/brains is removed — so it is signed only by "Remove the key", asked
                                 for by name, through POST /api/exchange (no secret rides it). Save with nothing typed signs no key, for
                                 any provider; for a server that needs none (Ollama, vLLM) given ANOTHER address it signs that address
                                 and the model with keyHash "" and salt "" (brSaveAddress, after a yes that says no key is signed and
                                 names where the desk's questions go), sent to POST /api/account/brain-key as { envelope } alone
     setDesk change "brain"      "Use this brain" (a desk is hired): { provider, model, effort?, price? } — one signature, after a yes that
                                 names all of them (effort only where the provider takes one of the desk's three; the price the owner's,
                                 or none: then the tokens are counted, not their cost)
   What it asks without a signature: POST /api/account/brain-test { provider } — "Test the saved key": one call the provider bills nothing
   for where it allows one (its model list), answered ok or in the provider's own words.

   CONNECT A KEY (brConnect): the paste row at the top of the sheet — and the same row in the Superagent's setup checklist, under "A brain
   key" — is one field for ANY provider's key and Connect, with no provider to pick. POST /api/account/brain-detect { apiKey }
   (account/brain-detect.ts) says whose the key is, by its shape and then by that provider's own answer to its list of models (which bills
   nothing; a plain sk- key may be asked of DeepSeek, Kimi and OpenAI in turn, which the row says before Connect is pressed), and the model
   the desk would think with — or why not, in plain words: a key it does not recognise (or the example from a how-to, a key starred out, a
   key that manages an account, another service's secret), the provider refused it, no answer in time, no usable model. Then one yes that
   shows all of it (brConfirmConnect), and the same signatures as by hand: setBrainKey, the key beside it, to /api/account/brain-key — and,
   a desk hired, setDesk change "brain"; or, where a form opened it, the pick put into that form. The key rides in those two requests only.
   Under the row, the brain in use: its model, the key's masked tail, Replace key and Remove key.

   THE KEY, which is a secret: it is typed (pasted) into one input, which has no name and sits in no form, so nothing that sweeps a form into
   a draft (formFields, quoteDialog, core formKeep) can ever take it into a /api/account/prepare or /api/exchange body. The input is
   type="text" drawn as dots (brains.css: -webkit-text-security: disc; every browser the page supports draws it — Chrome and Safari for
   years, Firefox since 114 — and where one does not, the input becomes type="password" rather than show the key), with autocomplete,
   autocapitalize, autocorrect and spellcheck off: a password field that a fetch "submits" is what browsers offer to keep in their password
   store (Chrome would offer to save an API key as a password for 127.0.0.1, and sync it), and a text field is not offered. It is read
   once, when Save is pressed: the input is emptied at once, the hash is made, the yes asked, setBrainKey prepared (the draft holds the hash
   and the salt, not the key) and signed, and the signature sent with the key beside it — never inside it — to POST /api/account/brain-key
   as { envelope, apiKey } (Owner.submitTo). The account checks the hash against the key before its door, runs the envelope through the door
   like any owner action, writes the key to its own file (readable by the owner alone) and answers with the key's masked tail; the page
   shows the fingerprint and that tail, nothing more. The key is never kept in a variable past that one request, nor in storage, a data
   attribute, the page's cache of reads (api()), a log line or a draft. A key typed and never saved is wiped from its field when the sheet
   closes, and when the page is put away (pagehide). A provider's base URL with http:// is refused here (and by the account) unless it is
   this machine's own address: anywhere else the key would travel unencrypted.

   A KEY IN THE WRONG FIELD. A key pasted into the model field, or into a base URL — its path, or its host where a provider's how-to leaves
   a part of the address to fill in (Qwen's {WorkspaceId}) — would be signed as that field: kept for good in the account's hash-chained
   ledger, written into its room, sent to the provider as a model's name, or sent in clear text in every DNS query for that host. So a
   value shaped like a key (brKeyShaped: the account's own check, account/brain-key.ts keyShaped, mirrored; brBaseKeyShaped for a base URL,
   each host label as typed and each path segment — Cloudflare's account id in its one place aside) is refused there before anything is
   signed or sent,
   with a warning beside the field as it is typed, in words that never repeat what was typed; the key typed into the key field and found
   again inside the model or the base URL is refused the same way. The desk's own forms (the hiring form, the superagent's setup:
   ui/desk.js dkBrainDraft) refuse it with the same words.

   THE AGENTS the owner may mean by "Muse", "Grok Bot" and "Instinct" have their own short section: as their makers' pages stood on that
   date, none is a model a program can ask — none takes a task over an API and gives an answer back — so none can be the desk's brain. The
   models behind two of them can, and are cards above (Muse · Meta Model API, Grok · xAI API). Instinct, either of the two products by
   that name, publishes no API at all yet. Nothing on this sheet pretends otherwise.

   Every string from outside (a label, a reason, a path, a model id, an answer) is escaped before it is drawn. */
