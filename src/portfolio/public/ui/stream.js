/* THE ACCOUNT'S PUSH CHANNEL, the page's end (GET /api/account/stream; the account's end is account/stream.ts). One stream a tab, opened
   once the shell has read the account (stStart), closed while the tab is hidden and opened again when it shows — naming the last event it
   heard (?since=), so what came meanwhile comes now, or a snapshot when the account no longer keeps it. What comes is handed to whoever
   listens (stOn), one event at a time, each listener's fault its own; nothing here draws anything but the dot that says how the stream
   stands (stDot). The polls the page always had stay: they are the fallback, and run much slower while the stream is connected.

   A browser without EventSource (and the test stand-in, which has none) never opens one: the health is "down" and the page reads the
   account by its polls, as it did before it had a stream.

     stOn(type, fn) → off()   fn(data, type) for each event of that type: order · fill · position · balance · paper · statement · card ·
                              desk · alert — a price alert fired: account/state.ts FiredAlert, with its venue's name — · snapshot (a
                              page that could not resume: read everything again), "*" for every one of them, and
                              "health" (fn(health)) when the health changes
     stHealth()               "connected" — open, and heard from in the last ST_STALE_MS (the account sends a heartbeat every 15 s) ·
                              "stale" — open, and silent for longer (a stream the network froze: closed and opened again after
                              ST_DEAD_MS) · "down" — not open: no EventSource, the tab hidden, the account not answering (the browser asks
                              again a second later, as the stream said), or refused (503: as many pages listen as the account keeps) —
                              opened again here after ST_RETRY_MS, longer each time
     stStart()                open it (once; the shell calls it after its first read)
     stFollow(keys, marks)    the markets this tab shows, each `<venue>:<symbol>` (ui/terminal.js says them as the market showing changes,
                              and as the pane is shown or put aside): `keys` the ones shown whole — their quote, book and trades come on the
                              stream as quote · book · trades events — and `marks` the ones whose price alone is shown (the positions'
                              marks under the panels: their quote only, said to the account with a "~" before the key, so it streams no
                              book for them), the account streaming them from the venues while a page shows them. Said again each time the
                              stream opens (an empty list too: a stream the account carried over from the last may still follow what this
                              tab no longer shows); a tab whose stream closed (hidden) follows nothing until it opens again, and an empty
                              list follows nothing at all. Each telling is numbered (one more each time), so the account takes the latest
                              of them however the requests overtake one another, and one it did not take is said once more
     stQuoteOf(venue, symbol) the latest quote the stream pushed for a market this tab follows, as it came (bid, ask, last, mark, funding,
                              its venue's moment `at`, `priceAt` its venue's own moment of the best bid and ask it carries, `seenAt` the
                              moment its stream last confirmed it, `from`, `live`, `seq` — and for a US share, whose real-time quote no venue
                              streams but the account reads over REST, `everyMs`, how often its source writes it where it is read as it
                              is written (Robinhood's), or `askedEveryMs`, how often the account asks a source that writes nothing on a
                              cadence of its own (Nasdaq's, stamped with its last trade to the minute), and `delayMs`, 0: its `at` and
                              `seenAt` are its own stamp) with `gotAt` — the moment this page had it — or
                              null: not followed, nothing pushed on the stream open now (what an earlier one pushed was let go as it
                              dropped: the account says each again when this one follows it), or the stream not connected now (a quote the
                              stream no longer carries is never taken as live)
     stPrice(q, perp)         the price a pushed quote stands for, as the account prices a market from its stream (live/paper.ts
                              streamed): a perpetual's the middle of its best bid and ask (its mark, else its last trade, where there is
                              no book), anything else its last trade (else the middle); undefined where it says none
     stDrawn(q)               a pushed quote has just been drawn (the market bar, the chart: inside the frame that shows it): how long
                              after its venue's own moment of its best bid and ask (`priceAt`) it reached the screen is kept, once for
                              each such moment — the last ST_LAG_N of them, nothing written anywhere, nothing logged — and stLag() says it:
                              { n, p50, p95, last } in ms, or null before any. A quote with no venue moment of its own is not counted,
                              nor a market's first on a stream (the stream's word on it as it stands, which may be from long before)
     stDot()                  every [data-st-dot] on the page says the health: a dot and a word, the rest on hover

   The tab names itself on its stream (ST_CLIENT, made when the page loads and never kept: a tab duplicated, or reloaded, is another page),
