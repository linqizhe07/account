/* The account page: the user's real accounts on one page, each read through the venue's own interface. It renders /api/account and
   signs what the owner asks for; it decides nothing the account did not. */
/* THE CONTRACT. The page is plain scripts sharing one global scope, run in this order after owner.js (the device key: Owner.prepare ·
   Owner.submit · Owner.act · Owner.why · Owner.role):
     core (this file) · stream · connect · money · asset · intent · live · portfolio · memory · earn · markets · trade · chart · book ·
     terminal · brains · desk · superagent · statement · agents-mount · shell (draws and starts it).
   Each top-level name is declared once across them all (test/unit/page-scripts.test.ts). Declare what the shell calls as top-level
   `function` declarations.

   What the page holds
     A            what GET /api/account said last (null until the first load)        S     the statement's lines (GET /api/account/statement)
     busy         an owner action is being signed and sent                            view  { month, account, type, agent } the statement's
     flash, said  a refusal / what was done: set them, then load() or render(), and          filters · lens: the top bar's lens, see lensNow()
                  the shell shows each once as a toast
     ROUTE        { tab: "portfolio" | "venues" | "memory" | "markets" | "trade" | "desk" | "superagent", params } from the hash
                  (#/markets?tab=crypto&q=btc · #/trade?kind=perps · #/trade?mode=superagent&venue=paper-1); the first three and the
                  desk are the Account (ACCOUNT_TABS), the first three opened from the rail's foot. Trade and the superagent are the
                  TRADING AREA (TRADE_AREA), one place in two modes the owner switches in one click from the top bar's Regular ·
                  Superagent: Regular is the terminal where you place your own orders (#/trade), Superagent the desk on a paper account
                  trading by itself (ui/superagent.js), #/trade?mode=superagent — "mode" never reaches the pane's params. #/superagent
                  (?venue=…) is kept as an alias: routed() rewrites it to the canonical hash in place. Inside the page the two keep their
                  own pane ids, "trade" and "superagent", so ROUTE.tab says which is showing
     tradeModeLast()              the mode the viewer used last ("regular" | "superagent", kept under TRADE_MODE_KEY in this browser):
                                  the rail's Trade opens it. Read in a guarded read; nothing writes it at load
     setTradeMode(mode, params)   the switch's click, and only it: the mode kept, then go() there
   Doing
     load({ draw })               read the account and the statement again, then render() (shell.js): the chrome, the visible pane, and
                                  the redraw of whatever sheet or drawer is open; the latest read wins over a slower earlier one. `draw`
                                  in place of render(): the shell's read after a pushed change draws only what moved where the owner is
                                  typing (shell.js shPushedDraw)
     forget(prefix)               the reads kept by api() whose path starts so, dropped: after an action changed what they said
     own(draft, then)             one owner action: prepare, sign with this browser's key, send at POST /api/exchange; then(r) after it
                                  went through; a refusal lands in flash in the venue's or the account's own words, what it did in said
                                  (saidOf(body): the summary, or the order or payment as it stands). Then load(). An account that does
                                  not answer is a refusal too (NO_ANSWER), never an exception out of a sheet
     cancelOrder(o, then)         a signed liveCancel of one order: an agent's after a yes, the owner's own with one click
     api(path, { ttl, timeout })  a JSON GET: one request at a time per path, kept ttl ms when asked. Resolves to the body, refusals
                                  included ({ ok:false, refusal }); refusalOf(body) is its sentence. Nothing that never came from the
                                  account (no answer, a gateway's page) is kept; a read not answered in `timeout` ms (15 s) is let go and
                                  answers as not reached ({ ok:false, error }), never a promise that hangs
     postJson(path, body)         a JSON POST → { status, body }; no answer → NO_ANSWER ({ status: 0, body: { ok: false, error } })
     FILLS_SAID                   the fills already said as a toast, by `${clientId}|${filledQty}` (when): the answer to the owner's own order
                                  and the account's pushed fill (shell.js shFillToast) say one fill once, whichever comes first
     orderWordsOnce(body, placed) what an answer says as a toast (saidOf), or "" where it is an order that placed and filled whose fill was
                                  said already (pushed first); otherwise its fill is marked said, so a push after it says nothing. Every
                                  path that places an order and toasts its answer takes its words from here: own(), quoteDialog's
                                  submit (the Close… sheet), the Trade ticket
   The account's push channel (ui/stream.js): stOn(type, fn) → off · stHealth() "connected" | "stale" | "down" · stStart() · stDot(). What
     the account pushes is applied in place by the shell (shell.js: an order's state, a position, the paper cash, a toast for each fill) and
     read again once for a burst; a pane that draws something the account changes listens for its own (superagent.js: desk)
     debounce(fn, ms)             later(ms): fn once, a little later, however often it is asked      thenLoad(fn)  a button's work, then load()
   Drawing (strings of HTML; escape what came from outside with esc)
     ageWords(at) (how old a price shown as now is: "" while fresh, "12 s old", "3 min old", "from 14:02 New York")
     esc · money (-$1,234.50) · fine (a cent or less as it was) · px (a price) · usd (a price in dollars, four figures under $1) · cents

     time that is not one) · typeText (an order's type) · isLive (an order on a book) · byOf (who did it) · readOnlyWords (a venue's words)
     chg(n, unit)                 a change, ▲ up / ▼ down with a word for screen readers, never colour alone; unit "%" · "$" · "¢" · ""
     avatar(sym, size, img)       a letter tile, and over it the logo at `img` where there is one ("sm" · "lg"; live/icons.ts)
     logoCredit(urls, cls) · creditFor(scope, el, cls)   the link Elbstream's free logos ask for, wherever one is shown
     icon(name, cls)              one of the sprite's stroke icons
     table(cols, rows, opts)      cols [{ label, r, cls, cell(row, i) }] (cls on the column's head and cells) · opts { empty, rowAttr(row, i), cls }
     seg(items, on, onChange, { label })   a toggle; items [[value, label], …]; onChange(value) when another is pressed
     paint(el, html)              el's HTML written only where it changed: the new HTML is laid over what is there (morphKids) — an element
                                  kept where it stands (or by its key among its siblings: data-k, else data-key), only the attributes and
                                  text that differ written, a row that did not change left alone; the focused control stays focused (and
                                  is found again by data-fk · data-key · its place only when it went). What every part drawn again on each
                                  read draws with. Listen on the part (one listener, by data attributes), never on what it drew: a control
                                  drawn again may be the same element. setText(el, t) an element's words set in place (its one text node)
     everySecond(fn)              fn() once a second, as the second turns over (every countdown and clock on the page, together; held while
                                  the page scrolls) → a function that stops it. fn reads and decides; it returns its writes as a function,
                                  and every write of that second is made in one frame (none at all in a second where nothing changed); false
                                  stops it. nextFrame(fn) the next frame (at once where there are none) · still() the owner asked for no
                                  motion · afterMotion(el, ms, fn) once el's own transition or animation ended (ms at the most; at once
                                  under still()) · whenStill(fn) once the page is not scrolling · paneLater(tab, fn) once a pane coming in
                                  has come in
     field · select · formFields(form) · setOptions(select, opts, value)   the form helpers;  download(name, rows) a CSV;  copyText(text, button)
     formKeep(form) → restore(formDrawnAgain)   what was typed in a form, put back after it is drawn again (never a password field; a
                                  select put back to another choice is told so with a change event, so what that choice shows agrees)
     whatYouSign(prepared, { open, notes })   the fields the owner signs, exactly as Owner.submit signs them (prepared.shown); notes a word
                                  beside a field, by name
   Sheets, the drawer, asking
     openSheet(html, { title, wide, redraw }) → the sheet's body element; closeSheet(). One sheet at a time (dialog#modal); redraw() runs
                                  after each load while it is open. An earlier dialog may still write #modal-form directly: it replaces the sheet
     openDrawer(html, { title, redraw }) → the drawer's body; closeDrawer(). A side sheet on the right; the page stays usable behind it
     confirmSheet(text, { danger, title, yes, no }) → Promise<boolean>      pickSheet(title, options, { current, note }) → Promise<value|null>
                                  (options [[value, label, hint], …] or { value, label, hint, disabled }); both stack over an open sheet
     quoteDialog({ title, sub, fields, draft, show, block, done, go, wide }) prepare → show → sign and send, in one sheet: draft(form)
                                  returns the draft, or a sentence saying what is missing; show(prepared, form) the quote in words (HTML);
                                  block(prepared, form) a sentence when the account would refuse what was prepared (shown before the sign
                                  button, which stays off and says why); done(r, prepared) after it went through (may return words for the
                                  toast); signNotes(prepared, form) words beside the signed fields, by name. The quote is asked again as the
                                  form changes (the latest ask wins) and when its ten minutes run out; a refusal shows in the venue's words
     toast(text | { html }, kind, { ms })   kind "ok" · "no" (read out at once, stays longer) · "info"
   Where the page is
     go(tab, params, { replace }) · onRoute(fn(tab, params, moved)) — moved: another tab than before (Regular ↔ Superagent is a move: the
     panes cross-fade) · hashOf(tab, params) the hash for a place (hashOf("superagent", { venue }) → #/trade?mode=superagent&venue=…) ·
     lensNow() → { kind: "all" | "venue" | "agent", id, name } · inLens(venue, agent)
   What an account can do
     connected() · nameOf(id) · keyName(address) · owns() · writesOn() · canTrade(v) · canMove(v) · keyOnlyReads(v) · watched(v) ·
     servedHere(v) · awayMiss(m) / awayLine(list, { fold }) (a venue a read left out because it does not serve this network: one quiet line) ·
     isAgentWallet(v) (never disconnected: emptied with Take back…) · modeOf(m) ("guard" | "open", whichever word a read uses) ·
     dollarsOf() · isDollar(asset) · networksOf() · bridgeChainsOf() (the lists the account publishes, the page's own as the fallback)
   A browser wallet sending what the account built: PROVIDERS (proven address → wallet) · SENT · INFLIGHT · walletFor(address) · mined(w, hash)
   What the panes define (the shell calls each if it is there): renderPortfolio(ctx) · renderVenues(ctx) [portfolio.js] · renderMemory(ctx)
     [memory.js] · renderMarkets(ctx) [markets.js] · renderTrade(ctx) [trade.js] · renderDesk(ctx) [desk.js] · renderSuperagent(ctx)
     [superagent.js], ctx = { el (#pane-…), owner, lens, params }; render() redraws only the visible pane, so keep what the owner is
     typing in an element you do not redraw. And the openers other parts call: openTicket(preset) · openClose(position) [trade.js] ·
     openHandToAgent(preset) [intent.js] · openReceive(venue) [money.js] · openLiveMove(venueId, preset) [money.js] · openAsset(key)
     [asset.js] · declineAsk(ask) [portfolio.js] · openMarket(item) [markets.js] · openPicker() / openConnect(option, opts) / connectVia(connector,
     opts) [connect.js] · openStatement() [statement.js] · openAgents() / openSettings() / openMode() [agents-mount.js; only the rail's
     "What changes ›" opens the Mode sheet] · openEarn(preset) / openSellMany(preset) [earn.js] · openBrains(ctx) [brains.js: the desk's
     brains, their keys typed once and never kept on the page]. Ask before calling one: typeof
     openTicket === "function". A pane that throws says so in its place.
   The classes the panes draw with (ui/shell.css; colours, radii, shadows and fonts only from ui/tokens.css, Light and Black alike). The
   look is the ocean with Swiss type: Inter everywhere, labels small and bold in sentence case, numbers bold and tight with tabular figures
   (.num .num-m), Geist Mono (.mono) only for a hash, an address or a line that is signed; content in glass cards over the ocean, a heavy
   rule across each card's top, nearly square buttons and toggles (a pressed one in ink), the Account's green for what is chosen (the red
   only for down, a sell or a loss).
     a card         .card — glass, a hairline of its own (--card-border) and a 2 px rule across its top (--rule), radius 4
                    (--radius-m), padding 18–20, no shadow (--shadow-card), its parts 14 apart; cards sit 20 apart in a column (.col-main .col-side). A .sec drawn
                    in a pane IS a card (the same look), so `class="sec"` and `class="card"` are one; inside a card, a sheet or the drawer a
                    .sec is a plain part under a hairline. A card whose last child is a table() runs the table nearly to its foot by itself
                    · .callout: waiting on the owner (warn fill, soft orange edge; its first .label in warn-text) · .box: a card with the
                    larger radius (a market card) · .panel: the sticky ticket (a lifted card, --shadow-lift)
     a card header  .card-head (or .sec-head) — one row: .h2 (20px 700) or .label on the left, .tools (links, a seg, a small button) on
                    the right; the first child of the card
     quick actions  .quick holding .quick-card buttons (or .btn): four equal cards, 52 high, an icon (icon()) and a word
     a pill         .btn (on the second surface, no outline) · .btn-primary (filled in the text colour) · .btn-ghost (the same pill, its
                    word dimmed) · .btn-danger (down on its fill) · .btn-sm (36 high; the rest 44) · .btn-block · a status word: .pill
                    (.warm) · a chip: .chip (a white pill with the card's shadow; .warm .bad) · a small word beside a name: .tag (.up .warn)
     a seg          seg() → .seg: a pill track on the second surface, the pressed button a white pill with the card's shadow. A toggle
                    drawn by hand is <div class="seg" role="group"> of buttons with aria-pressed
     and the rest   .cols .col-main .col-side (two columns, the side one 340–380) · .label .h2 · .icon-btn (44 round) .link · .tabs
                    (category tabs: buttons with aria-pressed, underlined) · .t (table(), at home in a card: light row rules) .acts ·
                    .cards-grid .tile-grid .choice (a tile that is a card) · .yes .no-btn (tinted up and down) · .av (avatar(), round)
                    .who · .bar with .legend-l .sw-k · .feed · .spark (.area .line) · .skel .skel-rows · .fld .row2 · .quote .path ·
