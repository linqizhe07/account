/* THE SUPERAGENT (#/trade?mode=superagent; the older #/superagent lands there too): Trade's second mode, beside Regular, switched in one
   click from the top bar's Regular · Superagent (account.html #trade-mode, shell.js). In Regular you place your own orders; here the
   account's own desk (account/desk.ts, drawn as cards on the Agents pane by ui/desk.js) trades a PAPER account by itself, shown as a live
   trading floor. It is the same desk, with the same eight seats — Head, Search,
   Risk, Sniper, Exit and Watch from the house, Flow and Sentiment open to an agent of the owner's own — plus one word the owner signs:
   autonomy on paper (setDesk autonomy {paper: true}). With it on, the desk's own seats place their orders at its paper account at once,
   each inside its seat's trading limit, instead of waiting for the owner on a card. Paper money only: the account refuses autonomy at a
   venue that is not a paper account, and turns it off when the desk's venue stops being one.

   NOTHING ON THIS PAGE IS MADE UP. Every figure is the desk's own record or a market's real read; every bubble on the floor is a line the
   room really holds; every packet that flies is a lead that really changed hands. An empty seat is drawn empty and says why; a brain that
   cannot think says its own reason and where its key goes; a part with nothing to show says so in words instead of drawing something. What
   moves without data (a mascot breathing, its blink) is decoration, and nothing on the page dresses it as a number. The desk's room speaks
   its own protocol ("LEAD L-0006 | AVAX/USD | long | … → RISK"): the page says each line in plain English where a person reads it
   (sgPlain), built from the lead's own record where there is one, the brain's own words kept as they are, and the line as written one
   pointer away (its title); the room itself is never rewritten.

   What it reads, and how often — only while this pane shows and the page is in view. The beat stops by itself otherwise, and starts again
   when the pane is drawn or the page comes back:
     GET /api/account/desk/feed?since=<seq>   every second: the room's lines after the last one seen, who is working and the brain calls
                                              under way, the last scan, the autonomy, the session, the equity's last points, the target,
                                              the funnel, the day, the last leads, the next cycle, the brain's standing and spend
     GET /api/account/desk                    every five seconds: the objective, the seats with their standing at the door and their
                                              limits, the full equity curve, the tape of closes, the open leads with their fees
     GET /api/account/desk/catalog            kept half a minute: the roles and their charters, the house seats' keys, the brains
     GET /api/account/candles                 the focus market's five-minute bars, every minute (the floor's wall screen; the analysis
                                              chart, ui/chart.js, reads the same path and shares it)
     GET /api/account/explore?limit=200       kept half a minute: the movers and the most traded, for the ticker (Markets' own read)
     GET /api/account/quotes                  the open leads' prices every five seconds: the balance's live point, summed as the desk sums
                                              it at each cycle (start + realised + each open lead's side × (mark − entry) × qty)

   THE FLOOR is ui/floor.js (flMount): a scene engine that reads nothing itself. Each second this page gives it the whole state
   (handle.set: sgFloorState) and one event for each thing that happened since the last read (handle.push), found by comparing one feed
   with the one before (sgDiff). The leads' own states decide the events — a lead that went from scanned to cleared is a handoff from
   Search to Risk, one that went to rejected goes into the shredder, an entry that appeared is a fill — and the room's lines are said as
   bubbles, each lead's events placed just after the line that speaks of it, so a bubble and its packet come in the order they happened.
   A read that comes after a gap (the pane put aside, the page hidden) draws what is now and replays nothing.

   THE REST OF THE PAGE, top to bottom: a header in the grammar of Hyperliquid's market bar (the desk, PAPER, its venue, the session's
   state and clock, and "How it works" — a sheet of what the desk is and does, sgHow; Equity, Target, Next cycle and the Brain as
   label-over-value stats — the Brain always a button, and drawn as one: edged, "Change ›" written on it, in amber "Connect a key ›" while it
   cannot think — that opens the Brains sheet (ui/brains.js): at its top one field to paste ANY provider's key ("Paste an API key", Connect
   — the account tells whose it is, checks it with that provider and switches the desk to its best model, after the owner's yes and
   signatures; in focus while the brain cannot think), then every provider the account offers, a key typed once, the model, Test, and "Use
   this brain", one signature; the owner's controls, each saying what it does where it is pointed at — Pause or Resume, Cycle now, Autonomy
   Cards | Auto on paper, End; an ended session's "Start again · auto on paper", ONE signature: setDesk resume carrying the autonomy, so the
   new session's first cycle already has it); the next step, only while there is one (sgNextHtml: "Connect a brain" while it cannot think,
   else "How to use it" in three lines until "Got it" puts it away in this browser); the "Waits for you" strip, only while a card of the
   desk's waits (each with Reject and Approve, the same signature the Agents pane asks); the floor; then one panel of tabs, one showing at
   a time and the one picked last kept in this browser (SG_TABS) — Seats: eight role cards (each seat's standing, its duty, its latest line
   typed out as it lands, its one real number); Balance: the desk's equity curve, its closes as bars, the big figure rolling; Chart: the
   focus market's chart and book, ui/chart.js and ui/book.js, and its leads as HL's positions table — mounted only while its tab shows;
   Room: the room's stream; Rules: the real numbers the hard checks use and the pipeline lit where the desk is working. A character picked
   on the floor turns to Seats and its card, the wall screen to Chart.
   NO DESK YET: what each mode is in one sentence, then — two columns on a wide pane, one on a narrow one — the steps (the form) beside a
   checklist read live from the first view (a paper account, a brain key: pasted right there, any provider's — the Brains sheet's own paste
   row, outside the form, its provider and best model put into the form once the owner signs (sgConnectAct); once a key is in, its masked
   tail and "Replace or remove the key ›" — or typed in the Brains sheet from "3 · The brain", or the key file the account names, with Copy
   — never a command composed here, never a sample key — and Start) and what the superagent is (its eight
   seats, each with its duty). What is typed in the form survives the form being drawn again when a key saved meanwhile flips a brain to
   ready (core formKeep). "Start the superagent"
   signs in order: approveAgent for each house seat, approveSpend for each seat that trades, setDesk hire, setDesk autonomy {paper: true}
   (sgSetupSteps). The owner starts it: the brain's calls cost money. While the owner signs, the frame on screen is held (SG.signing): the
   feed's beat finds the desk hired before the last step is answered, and the form must stay to say that answer; a refusal after the hire
   is said again under the floor's header and as a toast, since the form goes once the floor comes in.
   A DESK ON A REAL VENUE: said so, with a way to move it to a paper account (only with no lead open) or to look at it on Agents.
   WHILE THE ACCOUNT DOES NOT ANSWER: said in the page's own words, since when; after two misses the session's clock and the countdown stop,
   the floor dims and says since when (sgFloorState stale), and the beat asks less often (1, 2, 5, then every 10 s) until it answers.

   The look is Hyperliquid's trade app's grammar, on the trading area's tokens (ui/tokens.css html[data-area="trade"]): panels, controls,
   type and motion as Regular has them, so the two modes are one screen. Only the floor keeps a room of its own, in the page's background:
   light on Light, dark on Black (.sg-floor, ui/superagent.css; ui/floor.js reads it again when the page switches).
   Every string from outside is escaped before it is drawn. The parts are built once and painted with paint(): a read that changed nothing
   writes nothing. */
