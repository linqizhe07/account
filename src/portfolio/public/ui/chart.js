/* THE CHART — one market's price history as candles, the way a trading screen draws it: the bars its source keeps (GET /api/account/candles:
   a connected venue's own, or a public source's without a key), a volume pane under them where the bars carry volume, a price axis on the
   right and a time axis at the foot, a dashed line at the last price with its value in a tag on the axis, and a crosshair that reads any
   bar. SVG drawn as strings, no library.

   RANGES AND BAR SIZES (feat/paper-live phase H). The head has the ranges a trading screen offers — 1D 5D 1M 3M 6M YTD 1Y 5Y MAX — each
   asked of the account in the bar size it starts in (1D 1m · 5D 5m · 1M 1h · 3M and 6M 4h · YTD and 1Y 1D · 5Y and MAX 1W: live/history.ts
   RANGE_BAR, which the account keeps too), and a menu of the bar sizes (1m 5m 15m 1h 4h 1D 1W) that overrides the range's own: the range
   is still the stretch asked, in the bars the owner picked. A range pressed takes its own bar size again. The answer says the bars' size
   (a source that keeps only so many bars at a size draws a range in a coarser one: Hyperliquid's latest 5,000; the menu then says the size
   drawn, and why is said over the plot), whether older bars exist (`more`) and, where the history ends, why (`ends`), whose bars they are
   (`source`), what the prices are adjusted for, which hours the bars cover, what they were folded from — all said in the foot.

   MOVING THROUGH TIME. The first view fits the range: every bar it brought, side by side, as wide as fits (at most CH_MAX_SLOT pixels a
   bar, so a short history sits at the right). A drag moves it (the mouse, or a finger left and right: up and down still scrolls the page),
   the wheel zooms around the pointer (sideways it moves), a pinch zooms around its middle, and + and − zoom from the keyboard; a double
   click fits the range again. The crosshair and the readout stay with the pointer through all of it. Once the owner has moved the view and
   its left edge comes near the oldest bar, the account is asked for the page before it (`before`): a quiet "Loading older bars…" over the
   plot while it comes, the bars added on the left without the view jumping (nor the keys' crosshair leaving its bar), and — where the
   source's history ends — its own words there, and nothing more is asked. A page refused is said in its words and asked again only after a
   wait, and so is one that came back empty while older bars still exist (its source answered none, or only part: never taken for the end).
   Older bars of another source than the bars beside them (a share's Robinhood year, Nasdaq's daily bars before it) are never joined
   unmarked: a dashed seam where they meet, both sources in the foot ("before Mon 18 Oct 2021: Nasdaq · AAPL"), the far side's in the
   readout.

   NOTHING MADE UP. Every bar is the source's own: none is drawn between two it gave, and a price read never makes one. Where the source has
   no bar between two — a minute nobody traded, an exchange's quiet hours, the stretches its own words say it has none (`gaps`) — the slots
   stay EMPTY, never bridged (the crosshair over one says why); a hole longer than CH_GAP_SLOTS is that many empty slots and a dashed break
   line. A share's intraday bars step over the hours they do not cover (a night with no overnight data, a weekend) with a break line and no
   empty slots, and its daily bars over the days its market is closed (a closed day is not a missing bar). The live price (GET
   /api/account/quotes, every five seconds while the chart is mounted, its pane is
   showing and the page is) moves the LAST bar only — its close, and its high or its low where the price passes them — and only while the
   price's own time (the quote's stamp where its source stamps one, else the moment it was read) is inside that bar's interval. A PUSHED
   QUOTE — the account's stream (ui/stream.js quote events, for the market this tab shows: its venue's own stream, each message with the
   venue's own moment) — moves the last bar the same way as it comes, drawn in the next frame, at the market's LAST TRADE (a candle is its
   trades', so never at a best bid and ask's middle, a perpetual's too), and never starts one: a quote comes on every move of the best bid
   or ask, a mark or the market's state, and the last trade it carries may be from before the boundary — so the first quote past a bar's end
   says nothing traded after it. A PUSHED TRADE (ui/stream.js trades events: the market's latest, each at its venue's own moment) is the one
   live price that may START a bar: the first trade at or past the last bar's end opens the bar its moment falls in, at its own interval's
   boundary (chBarStart: Universal days, four-hour buckets from midnight and Monday weeks for a market that trades round the clock; New
   York's four-hour buckets from 04:00 for a share, and only inside the hours its bars keep, 04:00–20:00 or the regular session, on a
   weekday — never a share's daily or weekly bar, which is its regular session's own), at the venue's own one-minute open where the stream
   sent that minute's bar, else at the trade — and never one between (nothing this page heard traded there).
   Such a bar is the page's until the source has it: each read of the bars reconciles — the source's bar stands wherever the source has one,
   a bar started here is kept only while the source has none at its moment yet (it will: something traded there), and the bars are read
   again thirty seconds after one is started here. While pushed prices come, the read of the live price is only a slow fallback (once every
   thirty seconds), back on its five seconds when they stop. The
   account's own paper book's price (connector live:paper) is its source's listing as its venue last answered: placed by that moment
   (quoteAt), never by the moment the page read it, and one that says no moment moves no bar (a venue's own paper account, Alpaca paper or
   Hyperliquid testnet, answers fresh like any connected venue) — and the foot says how old the live price is once it is not the last few
   seconds'. A share's daily bar is its regular session's, so only a price from the regular session moves it (never an after-hours,
   overnight or pre-market one). A live price is laid over the bars only while it is fresh: one the venue then refused, or one read before a newer read of the bars,
   never stands in for the source's own close. Once the clock passes the last bar's end the bars are read again, and the source's next bar
   comes with them. A source that keeps no history says so in its own words in the panel, and nothing else is drawn there: no axes, no grid.

   Mounting (ui/terminal.js mounts it in the Trade pane's left panel; ui/superagent.js in its analysis)
     chMount(el, { venue, symbol, kind, quote, range, interval, log, priceStep, onRange, onInterval, onLog })
                    the chart drawn into el (its own frame inside: el keeps its classes): the ranges, the bar sizes' menu and the log
                    switch over the plot, the plot with the OHLC readout laid over its top-left corner (as a trading screen lays it: the
                    readout's words never change the plot's size), a quiet line under it saying whose bars they are and what they are.
                    `venue` a venue id on the account or a public source's id (Markets names both; a paper account's id passes through to
                    its market's public source), `symbol` the market as that venue names it, `kind` the Market's kind ("event": prices in
                    cents), `quote` what it is priced in ("USDT"; a Market may be passed instead: its quote and priceStep are read),
                    `range` one of the ranges (where none is named: the one a bar size alone is drawn over, live/history.ts INTERVAL_RANGE —
                    1h a month, 5m a day — else 1M), `interval` a bar size overriding the range's own, `log` a logarithmic price scale,
                    `priceStep` the market's own price step (its figures carry at least that many decimals, and more where the bars are
                    finer: a half cent stays a half cent), `onRange(r)`, `onInterval(iv)` and `onLog(on)` called when the owner picks
                    another, so the page can keep the choice. Mounting again on the same el — another market, another range — releases
                    the first: an answer meant for it is never drawn
     chLines(el, lines, { onDrag })
                    THE ACCOUNT'S OWN LINES over the plot (feat/paper-live phase 4): each { id, price, label, short (its kind and size
                    alone, what a narrow plot says), kind (buy · sell · tp · sl · entry · liq · trail), drag (a field the line's price may
                    be dragged to change: "limitPrice" or "stopPrice") } — an
                    order resting, a position's entry, its take-profit and stop-loss, its liquidation price — a line across the price pane
                    with its words at the left and its price in a tag on the axis, drawn where it is in view and nowhere else (the scale is
                    the bars', never stretched to a line). A line with `drag` may be pulled up or down: while it moves it says the price
                    it would go to, and let go it is handed to onDrag(line, price) — the page opens the order's change at that price, to be
                    SIGNED (an amend, as the Change button opens it): nothing is moved by the drag itself, and the line goes back to its own
                    price until the order is changed. Lines are drawn again with every frame the chart draws; nothing is asked for them
     chMarks(el, marks)
                    THE DESK'S TRADES on the chart (ui/superagent.js): each { id, t (the moment, ms), price, side (buy · sell), kind (in ·
                    out), label, short (what a narrow plot says), tone (up · down · ink), lead (an entry and an exit of one lead are
                    joined), fresh (it just happened: a ring pulses round its dot), float (an exit's result, floating up beside it once
                    while it is fresh), quiet (a dot alone: its words only on hover) } — a dot at the bar its moment falls in and at its
                    price, its words in a tag beside it (an entry's under it, an exit's over it, kept inside the pane and off one another),
                    the entry and the exit of one lead joined by a dashed line. A moment no bar holds (before the first, after the last
                    bar's end) and a price outside the pane are not drawn. Drawn with the lines, every frame; nothing is asked for them

   Drawing. The plot is five layers in one box: the picture (.ch-draw: the grid, the candles but the newest, the volume, the time axis, the
   break lines and seams), the live layer over it (.ch-live: the newest candle, the price axis's figures, the last price's line and tag — what a live
   price moves), the readout over the top-left corner (.ch-ohlc, laid over the plot: its box is out of the flow, so however long its words
   are, nothing around it moves; the price pane keeps room for it under the top edge), a quiet hint at the bottom left (.ch-hint: older bars
   loading, where the history ends) and the crosshair over all of them (.ch-cross: two lines and two tags, drawn once per size). ONLY WHAT
   IS SEEN IS DRAWN: the bars in view, and where more than one falls on a pixel's column, one candle for that column (its first open, its
   highest high, its lowest low, its last close: the bars' own extremes, never a price between). A live price that keeps the scale as it was
   redraws the live layer only — never the picture under it — and every redraw waits for the next frame, so a burst of ticks, a drag or the
   wheel is one drawing a frame. A pointer moving over the plot only moves the crosshair — a transform, its tags' places and words — and
   writes the readout; it never draws the candles again, and nothing it writes changes a box's size. The arrow keys move it bar by bar when
   the plot has the focus (Home · End · Escape), the view following it past either edge. The picture is drawn again when its box changes
   size (ResizeObserver; the window's resize where there is none), when the bars are read again, and when the view moves. The head and the
   foot are boxes of fixed height, so the plot's height is set once by the panel. Colours only from ui/tokens.css (chart.css), so Cream and
   Black alike. */
