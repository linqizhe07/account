/* Markets: what there is to trade — at the venues the owner connected, and (read without a key, "Connect to trade") at the venues not
   connected — from GET /api/account/explore, in the tabs it returns: All (one table, sorted here), Crypto, Stocks, RWAs, Perps, Pre-IPO,
   Predictions (Yes/No cards whose prices are asked again only while a card is in view and the page is in view: GET /api/account/quotes),
   and Watching — the owner's watchlist, and under it the owner's PRICE ALERTS. Over the All tab THE PULSE (after OpenStock's dashboard):
   the US stock market's session with a countdown, and the day in six figures — the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, Dow and Russell 2000 by the ETFs
   that track them, Bitcoin and Ethereum — each a tile that opens the market. The HEATMAP tab (ui/heatmap.js, after Finviz's map of the
   market): the US stock market's day as one picture, the largest companies as tiles sized by market cap and coloured by the day's change,
   packed by sector, each tile opening its market here. One market in THE ONE DRAWER (openMarket; a holding opens it
   by its key through openAsset, asset.js): its price, its history, every venue's price for it, what is held — positions to close, orders to
   cancel, what was paid — its price alerts, what the agents are doing in it, and its lines on the statement. Markets manages no accounts:
   connections live under Portfolio › Accounts and the Connect picker.
   Every button does what it says through the account's own door: an order opens the ticket and is signed there; ★ is a signed setWatch; 🔔
   opens the alert sheet, whose Set is a signed setAlert (the account itself prices the market every half minute and says the alert when it
   fires: service.ts watchAlerts, shell.js shAlertToast) and whose Remove is a signed setAlert too; "Connect to trade" opens that connection's
   own form; Cancel is a signed liveCancel (core cancelOrder); Close… is the Trade pane's signed close. Where a venue refuses, its own words
   are shown, and what fixes it. Nothing here is a sample. */
