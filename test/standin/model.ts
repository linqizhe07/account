/** The stand-in account's market: one price curve per thing traded, which moves a little every few seconds and also gives its own past —
 * the candles, the last 24 hours and the net worth curve's points are read off the same curve, so they agree with each other.
 *
 * A curve is three slow waves on top of one another (minutes, hours, days), plus a ramp over the 24 hours before the stand-in started that
 * makes its 24-hour change at the start exactly the one it was given. A price lives in log space; an event contract's price (a probability)
 * lives in logit space, so it stays between 0 and 1. On top of the curve, `now()` adds a few seconds' jitter that `tick()` moves. Nothing
 * here is random from run to run except the jitter: the waves are seeded from each curve's name.
 *
 * Nothing here is any venue's data. It is made up, and every page that shows it is the stand-in's.
