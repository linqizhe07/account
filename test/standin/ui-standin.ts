/** A STAND-IN ACCOUNT: the real account page, server and doors, over stand-in venues — to look at and click through the page with NO
 * network and NO real money.
 *
 *   npx tsx test/standin/ui-standin.ts --port 4821      (never 4820: that port is the real account's)
 *     --cap 250        the most one order or movement may be worth (the server's --live-cap)
 *     --tick 3000      how often prices move, in milliseconds
 *     --no-desk        no desk hired: the page's own setup, with the real brains behind it — every preset the account knows (brains.ts:
 *                      Claude, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Grok · xAI, Muse · Meta, Kimi, Qwen, OpenRouter, Gemini, Groq, Together, Ollama,
 *                      vLLM, a custom endpoint) — each saying honestly that this home holds no key for it (the no-key fix: its key file's
 *                      path and the command that makes it), and Ollama and vLLM, which need no key and no file, that they need a model's
 *                      name. A key saved for one of them makes it ready (a local server: a model named for it), but the stand-in reaches no
 *                      network: its calls and its "Test the key" answer that the endpoint could not be reached
 *     --superagent     the desk hired as the SUPERAGENT at the account's own paper account (paper-momentum), its autonomy on paper signed,
 *                      its clock running every ten seconds and a cycle every minute, the first a few seconds after the start
 *     --cards          with --superagent: hired with the autonomy OFF, so in Guard every lead it clears waits for you on a card — the
 *                      Superagent pane's "Waits for you" strip, with real cards to approve or reject
 *     --brain-refuses  the scripted brain answers as the API does to a key it refuses (E_BRAIN_KEY_REJECTED, brain-key.ts): the desk's
 *                      standing turns "not ready" with the rejected-key fix, and the room says so once. The stand-in writes a stand-in key
 *                      to <home>/credentials/anthropic/api-key.json at the start; change what that file holds (the fix's command opens
 *                      it), or save a key for Claude on the page (credentials/brains/claude.json, which is read before it), and the next
 *                      call is answered, as a replaced key would be
 *
 * THE BRAINS. With a desk (the default, --superagent), the desk thinks with a SCRIPT — never a model — held under Claude's preset id
 * ("claude", labelled "A script (stand-in, as Claude)"), beside every other preset's real brain: so the Brains place shows every provider
 * with its honest standing (no key in this fresh home; Ollama and vLLM ready once a model is named, needing neither key nor file), and
 * switching the brain away and back can be clicked through. The real brains here read no variable from the shell that started the stand-in
 * (so no ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL or OPENAI_API_KEY there changes what the page shows) and reach no network: a key saved on the page makes one
 * ready, and its calls then answer that the endpoint could not be reached.
 *
 * It starts the account exactly as `npm run account` does — real accounts only, trading on with a small cap, a pairing code printed here —
 * on a fresh temporary home, with every live connection's reach replaced by a stand-in (test/standin/venues.ts): the venues, the public
 * market data, the network (every request answers "no network"), the chains (an agent wallet's balance is the stand-in's), the payees (no
 * one is paid) and the mm command line. Nothing leaves the process.
 *
 * What it seeds, all of it through the account's own door — owner actions signed by the stand-in's seed key, agent actions by a simulated
 * agent key, the way the tests sign them:
 *
 *   venues        Stand-in Exchange (spot and perpetuals, a BTC perpetual it already held, and earn: a flexible USDT product and a bonded
 *                 ETH one), Stand-in Predictions (event contracts), Stand-in Wallet (tokens, an RWA among them), Stand-in Broker (AAPL,
 *                 NVDA and SPY in New York's market hours by the stand-in's clock; $2,000 in cash, 3 AAPL and 2 NVDA held); agents may set
 *                 leverage up to 5x. Each trader says the kinds of market it trades itself (live/trade.ts `kinds`)
 *   the owner's   a market buy of ETH, a resting limit buy of SOL (it fills when the price comes down to it), a limit sell of BTC above the
 *   own trading   market, a stop under SOL, 5x on the ETH perpetual and a long there, 50 YES contracts on the Fed, WETH bought from the
 *                 wallet, a limit placed and canceled; at the broker, while the US market is open, market buys of half a share of AAPL and
 *                 a share of NVDA (while it is closed no market order is taken: the broker held them already), and a limit buy of a
 *                 quarter share of SPY under the market — on the book, or held by the broker until the open; a fraction of a share is a
 *                 day order, so it lapses at its session's close; spot to futures, USDC swapped for USDT, $25 withdrawn to the agent's
 *                 wallet, $150 of USDT put into the flexible earn product (done on the next tick)
 *   the agent     "Claude Code": let in for 30 days, a trading limit ($150 an order, $600 in all, at the three venues), a limit between the
 *                 user's own places and a payees limit, an agent wallet; in Beast it places a limit buy of SOL inside its limit, then
 *                 in Guard it asks for a market buy of ETH, which waits on a card for the owner
 *   steering      two intents (one to Claude Code, one to every agent), Claude Code's report on the first, two asks (a bigger budget, a
 *                 venue connected), three watched markets — one at a venue that is not connected
 *   memory        what Claude Code remembers about the owner (account/memory.ts): two notes the owner wrote, two it learned, each
 *                 saying how (Account › Memory)
 *   the curve     net worth points over the last seven days, off the stand-in's own price curves, so the curve draws at once
 *
 * PAIRING. The seed key paired first, with the code, the way a browser does. The page then asks this browser for the code too: typed
 * right, the seed key signs one owner action (convertToMultiSigUser) that makes this browser an owner beside it, one signature enough.
 * The seed key stays an owner because every limit it signed is checked against the owners each time it is used: a limit whose signer is
 * gone no longer stands. A second browser after that waits until an owner lets it in under Devices, as on the real account.
 *
 * The agent wallet's key is made in the home the way a real one is (account/keystore.ts), so its address is a real address on every EVM
 * chain: its balance here is the stand-in chain's, and nothing real should ever be sent to it.
 *
 * While it runs: prices move every few seconds, a resting order fills when the price crosses it (at the broker, only while the US market
 * is open), a stop fires, the fifteen-minute bitcoin market rolls over and settles; Claude Code reports when its order fills, and when its
 * card expires unanswered the seed key closes it and Claude Code asks again (in Guard only).
